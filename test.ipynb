       "rec.array([('To whom it may concern:\\nElon Musk’s takeover of Twitter will further toxify our information ecosystem \\nand be a direct threat to public safety, especially among those already most \\nvulnerable and marginalized.  \\nTwitter has outsized influence in shaping both public discourse and industry-\\nwide platform governance standards. While the company is hardly a poster-\\nchild for healthy social media, it  has taken welcome steps in recent years to \\nmitigate systemic risks, ratcheting up pressure on the likes of Facebook and \\nYouTube to follow suit. Musk intends to steamroll those safeguards and provide \\na megaphone to extremists who traffic in disinformation, hate, and harassment. \\nUnder the guise of ‘free speech,’ his vision will silence and endanger marginalized \\ncommunities, and tear at the fraying fabric of democracy.\\nThe undersigned organizations believe that Twitter should continue to uphold the \\npractices that serve as guideposts for other Big Tech platforms. We call on you – \\nTwitter’s top advertisers – to commit to these standards as non-negotiable \\nrequirements for advertising on the platform:\\n1. Keep accounts including those of public figures and politicians that were \\nremoved for egregious violations of Twitter Rules – such as harassment, \\nviolence, and hateful conduct – off the platform and continue to enforce \\nthe civic integrity policy  along with the hateful conduct policy . Since 2020, \\nTwitter has applied its civic integrity policy to all users, including elected \\nofficials. Musk’s statements at Ted2022 last week indicate that he will \\nroll-back permanent bans and err on the side of allowing harmful content \\nto remain on the platform under the guise of ‘free speech.’ A reversal of \\nTwitter’s content moderation policies including its recently released climate \\ncommitments, its protections for transgender people, and its restrictions on \\nother forms of hate, harassment, and violence would be toxic not just for those \\ntargeted, but also for businesses advertising on the platform.\\n2. Beyond algorithmic transparency, ensure algorithmic accountability, \\npreserve people’s privacy, and commit to depolarizing the algorithm. \\nConsider the implications of full-scale public visibility into Twitter’s algorithm \\nand put protections in place to prevent bad actors from gaming the system. \\nListen to privacy experts and others whose expertise includes protecting \\ncommunities that are discriminated against in speaking truth to power. \\nContinue the work of its in-house research team called Machine Learning \\nEthics, Transparency and Accountability that looks at potential biases in \\nAccess Now\\nAccountable Tech\\nBlack Lives Matter Global Network Foundation\\nCenter for Countering Digital Hate\\nEmpowering Pacific Islander Communities (EPIC)\\nFace the Music Collective\\nFair Vote UK\\nFree Press\\nFriends of the Earth\\nGender Equity Policy Institute\\nGLAAD\\nGlobal Project Against Hate and Extremism\\nIndivisible Northern Nevada\\nKairos\\nMedia Matters for America\\nMediaJustice\\nNARAL Pro-Choice America\\nNational Hispanic Media Coalition\\nReligious Coalition for Reproductive Choice\\nReproaction\\nStop Online Violence Against Women Inc\\nThe Sparrow Project\\nUltraViolet\\nUnion of Concerned Scientists\\nV-Day/One Billion Rising\\nWomen’s Marchits algorithms including published research, for instance, on whether the \\nalgorithms that automatically crop profile photos contained inadvertent bias.\\n3. Continue Twitter’s commitment to transparency and researcher access. \\nTwitter stands out for its support of researchers – both internal and external \\nto the company. From its API for academic research to its willingness to \\npublish critique and its internal learnings, Twitter has demonstrated a \\ncommitment to transparency and access for researchers that sets an example \\nfor other Big Tech companies and allows for accountability.\\nAs top advertisers on Twitter, your brand risks association with a platform \\namplifying hate, extremism, health misinformation, and conspiracy \\ntheorists. Under Musk’s management, Twitter risks becoming a cesspool of \\nmisinformation, with your brand attached, polluting our information ecosystem \\nin a time where trust in institutions and news media is already at an all-time low.  \\nYour ad dollars can either fund Musk’s vanity project or hold him to account. We \\ncall on you to demand Musk uphold these basic standards of community trust \\nand safety, and to pull your advertising spending from Twitter if they are not.\\nSincerely,', 'Business Documents'),\n",

The_Marriage_of_Heaven_and_Hell  \\n  by William Blake  \\n \\nPLATE 14  \\n \\n  The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the  \\nend of six thousand years is true. as I have heard from Hell.  \\n  For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to  \\nleave his guard at the tree of life, and when he does, the whole  crea- \\ntion will be consumed, and appear infinite. and holy whereas it now  \\nappears finite & corrupt.  \\n  This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment.  \\n  But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul, is to  \\nbe expunged; thi s I shall do, by printing in the infernal method, by  \\ncorrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent  \\nsurfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.  \\n  If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear  \\nto man as it is: infinite.  \\n  For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro\\' narrow  \\nchinks of his cavern.  \\n \\n----- \\n \\nPLATE 15  \\n                         A Memorable Fancy  \\n \\n  I was in a Printing house in Hell & saw the method in which  \\nknowledge is tra nsmitted from generation to generation.  \\n  In the first chamber was a Dragon -Man, clearing away the rubbish  \\nfrom a caves mouth; within, a number of Dragons were hollowing the  \\ncave,  \\n  In the second chamber was a Viper folding round the rock & the  \\ncave, and o thers adorning it with gold silver and precious stones.  \\n  In the third chamber was an Eagle with wings and feathers of air,  \\nhe caused the inside of the cave to be infinite, around were numbers  \\nof Eagle like men, who built palaces in the immense cliffs.  \\n  In the fourth chamber were Lions of flaming fire raging around &  \\nmelting the metals into living fluids.  \\n  In the fifth chamber were Unnam\\'d forms, which cast the metals  \\ninto the expanse.  \\n  There they were reciev\\'d by Men who occupied the sixth chamber,  \\nand took the forms of books & were arranged in libraries.  \\n   \\nWhen I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer \\n \\n         by Walt Whitman \\n  When I heard the learn\\'d astronomer,   When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,  \\n \\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide,      and measure them,  \\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with \\n    much applause in the lecture-room,  How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, \\n \\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\\'d off by myself,  In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,   Look\\'d up in perfect silence at the stars. \\n \\n \\n*  *  * \\n  \\nO Captain! My Captain! \\n by Walt Whitman  O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, The ship has weather\\'d every rack,       the prize we sought is won, The port is  near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, \\n      While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel  grim and daring; But O heart! heart! heart! \\n      O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead.       O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for       you the bugle trills,                                     \\n         For you bouquets and ribbon\\'d wreaths- for you the shores \\n             a-crowding,           For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;              Here Captain! dear father!                This arm beneath your head! \\n                 It is some dream that on the deck, \\n                   You\\'ve fallen cold and dead.            My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,           My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,           The ship is anchor\\'d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, \\n          From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; \\n               Exult O shores, and ring O bells!                  But I with mournful tread,                    Walk the deck my Captain lies,                      Fallen cold and dead. The_War_Prayer  \\n   by Mark Twain  \\n \\n    It was a time of great and exalting excitement. The country was up in arms, the war was on, in \\nevery breast burned the holy fire of patriotism; the drums wer e beating, the bands playing, the toy \\npistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and sputtering; on every hand and far down the \\nreceding and fading spreads of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the \\nsun; daily the young v olunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new \\nuniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices \\nchoked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, \\npanting, t o patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts and which they \\ninterrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the \\nwhile; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country a nd invoked the God of \\nBattles, beseeching His aid in our good cause in outpouring of fervid eloquence which moved \\nevery listener.  \\n    It was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to \\ndisapprove of the war and cast a  doubt upon its righteousness straightway got such a stern and \\nangry warning that for their personal safety\\'s sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended \\nno more in that way.  \\n    Sunday morning came - next day the battalions would leave for the fro nt; the church was filled; \\nthe volunteers were there, their faces alight with material dreams - visions of a stern advance, the \\ngathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the \\nenveloping smoke, the fierce  pursuit, the surrender! - then home from the war, bronzed heros, \\nwelcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones, \\nproud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth  \\nto the field of honor, there to win for the flag or, failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. The \\nservice proceeded; a war chapter from the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it \\nwas followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose, \\nwith glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation -- \"God the all -\\nterrible! Thou who ordainest, Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!\"  \\n    Then came the \"long\" prayer. None could rememb er the like of it for passionate pleading and \\nmoving and beautiful language. The burden of its supplication was that an ever -merciful and \\nbenignant Father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers and aid, comfort, and \\nencourage them in their pat riotic work; bless them, shield them in His mighty hand, make them \\nstrong and confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and \\nto their flag and country imperishable honor and glory  --  \\n    An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle, his eyes \\nfixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his \\nwhite hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally  pale, pale \\neven to ghastliness. With all eyes following him and wondering, he made his silent way; without \\npausing, he ascended to the preacher\\'s side and stood there, waiting.  \\n    With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued his m oving prayer, and at \\nlast finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal,\"Bless our arms, grant us the victory, O \\nLord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!\"  \\n    The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside - which the sta rtled minister did - and \\ntook his place. During some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes in \\nwhich burned an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said  \\n    \"I come from the Throne - bearing a message from Almighty God!\" The words smote the \\nhouse with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention. \"He has heard the prayer of \\nHis servant your shepherd and grant it if such shall be your desire after I, His messenger, shall \\nhave explained to you its import - that is to say , its full import. For it is like unto many of the \\nprayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of - except he pause and \\nthink.  \\n    \"God\\'s servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and taken thought? Is it one \\npraye r? No, it is two -  one uttered, the other not. Both have reached the ear of His Who heareth \\nall supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this - keep it in mind. If you beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a cu rse upon a neighbor at the \\nsame time. If you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are \\npossibly praying for a curse upon some neighbor\\'s crop which may not need rain and can be \\ninjured by it.  \\n    \"You have heard your  servant\\'s prayer - the uttered part of it. I am commissioned by God to put \\ninto words the other part of it - that part which the pastor, and also you in your hearts, fervently \\nprayed silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so! You  heard these \\nwords: \\'Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!\\' That is sufficient. The whole of the uttered prayer \\nis compact into those pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have prayed \\nfor victory you have prayed for many unmentioned res ults which follow victory - must follow it, \\ncannot help but follow it. Upon the listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken part of \\nthe prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words.  \\nListen!  \\n    \"O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle –  \\nbe Thou near them!  With them, in spirit, we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved \\nfiresides to smite the foe.  O Lord our God,  \\nhelp us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells;  \\nhelp us to co ver their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead;  \\nhelp us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain;  \\nhelp us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire;  \\nhelp us to wring the hear ts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief;  \\nhelp us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their \\ndesolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds \\nof winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and \\ndenied it -  \\nfor our sakes who adore Thee, Lord,  \\nblast their hopes,  \\nblight their lives,  \\nprotract their bitter pilgrimage,  \\nmake heavy their steps,  \\nwater thei r way with their tears,  \\nstain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet!  \\nWe ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is ever - faithful \\nrefuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble an d contrite hearts.  \\nAmen.\"  \\n \\n(After a pause)  \\n \\n\"Ye have prayed it; if ye still desire it, speak! The messenger of the Most High waits.\"  \\n \\nIt was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic, because there was no sense in what he said.  Clancy of the Overflo w \\n   by A.

What price bananas?  Are you my Angel?  \\n  I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans  \\nfollowing you, and followed in my imagination by the store  \\ndetective.  \\n  We strode down the open corrid ors together in our solitary  \\nfancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy,  \\nand never passing the cashier.  \\n  Where are we going Walt Whitman?  The doors close in an  \\nhour.

It is difficult for anyone to\\nlive in places where there is no water to drink, where\\nthere is no grass for their cattle to feed on and where\\nthere is no water to help the crops to grow.\\nWe will now learn about the places in the world where\\npeople have learned to cope with extreme harsh\\ntemperatures; in some places as hot as fire and some as\\ncold as ice. These are the desert areas of the world. These\\nare characterised by low rainfall, scanty vegetation and\\nextreme temperatures. Depending on the temperaturesthere can be hot deserts or cold deserts. The people\\ninhabit these lands wherever little water is available to\\npractise agriculture.\\nTHE HOT DESERT – S AHARA\\nLook at the map of the world and the\\ncontinent of Africa. Locate the Sahara\\ndesert covering a large part of North\\nAfrica. It is the world’s largest desert. It\\nhas an area of around 8.54 millionsq. km. Do you recall that India has an\\narea of 3.2 million sq. km? The Sahara\\ndesert touches eleven countries. These\\nare Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali,\\nMauritania, Moro cco, Niger, Sudan,\\nTunisia and Western Sahara.\\nWhen you think of a desert the picture\\nthat immediately comes to your mind is that of sand. But\\nbesides the vast stretches of sands, that Sahara desert is\\ncovered with, there are also gravel plains and elevatedplateaus with bare rocky surface. These rocky surfaces\\nmay be more than 2500m high at some places.\\nFig. 10.1:  The Sahara Desert\\nGlossary\\nDesert:  It is an arid\\nregion characteriesed\\nby extremely high or\\nlow temperatures andhas scarce vegetation.72OUR ENVIRONMENT\\nDo you know?Fig. 10.2:  Sahara in Africa\\nAl Azizia in the Sahara\\ndesert, south of Tripoli,Libya recorded the\\nhighest temperature of\\n57.7°C in 1922.Climate\\nThe climate of the Sahara desert is scorching hot and\\nparch dry. It has a short rainy season. The sky iscloudless and clear. Here, the moisture evaporates\\nfaster than it accumulates. Days are unbelievably hot.\\nThe temperatures during the day may soar as high as\\n50°C, heating up the sand and the bare rocks, which\\nin turn radiates heat making everything around hot.The nights may be freezing cold with temperatures\\nnearing zero degrees.\\nFlora and Fauna\\nVegetation in the  Sahara desert includes cactus, date\\npalms and acacia.

Among them are the Bedouins and\\nTuaregs. These groups are nomadic tribes rearing\\nlivestock such as goats, sheep, camels and horses.\\nThese animals provide them with milk, hides from\\nwhich they make leather for belts, slippers, waterbottles; hair is used for mats, carpets, clothes and\\nblankets. They wear heavy robes as protection against\\ndust storms and hot winds.\\nThe oasis in the Sahara and the Nile Valley in Egypt\\nsupports settled population. Since water is available, the\\npeople grow date palms. Crops such as rice, wheat, barley\\nand beans are also grown. Egyptian cotton, famousworldwide is grown in Egypt.\\nThe discovery of oil – a product in great demand\\nthroughout the world, in Algeria, Libya and Egypt isconstantly transforming the Sahara desert. Other\\nminerals of importance that are found in the area include\\niron, phosphorus, manganese and uranium.\\nThe cultural landscape of the Sahara is undergoing\\nchange.

The air at this altitude is so thin that the\\nheat of the sun can be felt intensely. The day\\ntemperatures in summer are just above zero degreeand the night temperatures well below –30°C. It is\\nfreezing cold in the winters when the temperatures may\\nremain below –40°C for most of the time.

There are\\nscanty patches of grasses and shrubs for animals tograze. Groves of willows and poplars are seen in the\\nvalleys. During the summers, fruit trees such as apples,\\napricots and walnuts bloom. Several species of birds are\\nsighted in Ladakh. Robins, redstarts, Tibetan snowcock,\\nraven and hoopoe are common. Some of these aremigratory birds. The animals of Ladakh are wild goats,\\nwild sheep, yak and special kinds of dogs. The animals\\nare reared to provide for the milk, meat and hides.

The hair of the\\nsheep and goat is used to make woollens.\\nPeople\\nDo you find any resemblance between the people of\\nLadakh and the inhabitants of Tibet and Central Asia?\\nThe people here are either Muslims or Buddhists. In\\nfact several Buddhists monasteries dot the Ladakhilandscape with their traditional ‘gompas’. Some\\nfamous monasteries are Hemis, Thiksey, Shey and\\nLamayuru (Fig. 10.5).\\nIn the summer season the people are busy cultivating\\nbarley, potatoes, peas, beans and turnip. The climate inwinter months is so harsh that\\npeople keep themselves engaged in\\nfestivities and ceremonies. The\\nwomen are very hard working. They\\nwork not only in the house andfields, but also manage small\\nbusiness and shops. Leh, the capital\\nof Ladakh is well connected both by\\nroad and air.

The teacher will create alist of desert creatures. The number of the creatures should be same as the numberof students in the class. The creatures can be picked up from the categories ofmammals, birds and reptiles. Mammals can include – camel, yak, fox, sheep, goat,antelope…Birds – raven, eagle, vulture, turkey…Reptiles – snakes …\\nAssign one desert creature to each student. Ask the student to write three\\ncharacteristics of the creature on plain sheet of paper. (students can use index\\ncards of size 10 cm × 15 cm). Questions such as - in what type of deserts it isfound? Major adaptation? Use to man?\\nThese characteristics will be used as clues in the guessing game. On the board\\nmake three columns – mammals, birs and reptiles. Paste a sheet of paper in thecolumn under the particular category. The class can be divided in three to fourgroups. They will compete against each other in the ‘desert game’. Each group nowtakes turn in guessing the correct answer. Explain to the class that they have toguess what animal matches the characteristics listed on the paper.For example:\\n\\x81 Animal of hot desert\\x81 Has double set of eyelashes to keep away the sand\\x81 The hide is used for making water bottles\\n The correct answer is ‘camel’. Within the group there will be a student who hasprepared the card. That student should not answer. Ten points are awarded for\\nthe correct answer.\\nThis game will enable students to understand the desert. You can play the\\nsame game by taking different types of fruits, flora and the clothes the people wear.6.

Financial Statements\\nof the General Department \\n \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 655 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001  \\nT: (202) 414 1000, www.pwc.com/us  \\n \\n \\nReport of Independent Auditors  \\n \\nTo the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund  \\n \\nOpinion  \\n \\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International \\nMonetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30, \\n2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves, \\nretained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes \\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  \\n \\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \\nposition of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash \\nflows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued \\nby the International Accounting Standards Board.  \\n \\nBasis for Opinion  \\n \\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of \\nAmerica (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our \\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit \\nof the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International \\nMonetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant \\nethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United \\nStates of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for \\nProfessional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  \\n \\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial \\nStatements  \\n \\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in \\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting \\nStandards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the \\npreparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error.  \\n \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to \\ncontinue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting \\nperiod , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of \\naccounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has \\nno realistic alternative but to do so.  \\n \\n   \\n \\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting \\nprocess.  \\n \\nAuditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  \\n   \\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that \\nincludes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and \\ntherefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always \\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing \\nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material \\nif there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment \\nmade by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  \\n \\nIn performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: \\n \\n● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  \\n● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \\nfraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such \\nprocedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \\nthe financial statements.  \\n● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit \\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an \\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is \\nexpressed.   \\n● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant \\naccounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the \\nfinancial statements.  \\n● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, \\nthat raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a \\nreasonable period of time.  \\n \\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the \\nplanned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related \\nmatters that we identified during the audit. \\n \\nSupplemental Information  \\n \\nOur audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a \\nwhole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and \\nfor the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are \\npresented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The \\nsupplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to \\nthe underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information \\nhas been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain \\nadditional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying \\naccounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements  \\n \\nthemselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the \\ninformation to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are \\nfairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the fina ncial statements taken as a whole.  \\n \\n \\n \\nJune 24, 2022  \\n \\n \\nI.

Nature of operations \\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international \\norganization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s \\nfundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the \\ninternational monetary system. It does so in three ways: \\nsurveillance of the global economy and the economies of \\nmember countries; lending to  countries with balance of \\npayments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.  \\nThe IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the \\nGeneral Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA); \\n(ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA). \\n1.1  General Resources Account \\nThe financial operations of the IMF with its members are \\nprimarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota \\nsubscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings \\nand repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions \\nand interest to lenders, and other operations. \\nA core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial \\nassistance to member countries experiencing actual or \\npotential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of \\na member country, GRA resources are made available either \\nunder a financing arrangement or in the form of outright \\npurchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by \\nthe IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a \\nmember the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide \\nresources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the \\nrelevant financing instrument.  \\nThe Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members \\nwith balance of payments problems expected to be resolved \\nin the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility \\n(EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of \\nwhich would require structural and more comprehensive \\neconomic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member \\nimplements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the \\nExecutive Board. \\nThe Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with \\nvery strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of \\npolicy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line \\n(SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several \\ninnovative features, including revolving access. It has the \\nsame qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for \\nmembers facing potential moderate short-term balance of \\npayments needs arising due to capital account pressures. \\nThe Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for \\nmembers with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the \\nqualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.  \\nThe financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid \\nFinancing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing \\nan urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or \\ncapacity for a full-fledged program. \\n1.2  Investment Account \\nThe IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are \\ninvested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board \\nprovide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth \\nAmendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which \\nbecame effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two \\nsubaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.  \\nThe Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred \\nfrom the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales. \\nWith a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s \\nbalance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income \\nSubaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights \\n(SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate \\n(see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the \\nfrequency and extent of negative returns and \\nunderperformance over an investment horizon of three to \\nfour years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the \\nExecutive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed-\\nIncome Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a \\nmargin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with \\nSDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial \\nyears 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering \\nthe IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the \\nlong-term real value of these assets.  \\n1.3  Special Disbursement Account \\nThe SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second \\nAmendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978). \\nSDA resources can be used for various purposes, as \\nspecified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and \\ntransactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and \\ntransactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the \\nIMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the \\nmandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income \\nmember countries. \\n1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF \\nThe IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights \\nDepartment (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional \\nLending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s \\npurposes. As the General Department does not have control \\nover these entities, their finan cial statements are presented \\nseparately. \\nThe resources of the SDR Department are held separately \\nfrom the assets of all t he other accounts owned or \\nadministered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of \\nthe General Department (or vice versa), except that \\nexpenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed \\nby the SDR Department.  \\nThe resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are \\ncontributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by \\nthe IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the \\ntrusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets \\nof the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to \\nmeet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the \\noperations of the General  Department. The General \\nDepartment can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in \\nconducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in \\naccordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and \\nrelevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic \\ndevelopments \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in \\nglobal economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis \\nwith unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial \\nassistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency \\nfinancing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements \\nand augmented existing lending arrangements to \\naccommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, \\nand 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased \\nfinancing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level. \\nThe evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant \\nuncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth \\nand elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further \\ndemand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to \\nhave a significant negative effect on global growth through \\ncommodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war \\ncould also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.  \\nThe General Department continues to manage its risks in \\naccordance with its existing risk management framework \\n(see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements, \\nthere had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment \\nanalysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note \\n2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in \\nthe preparation of thes e financial statements. \\nThe risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have \\neffectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the \\nglobal developments on the investment portfolios. The \\nvaluations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully \\nand rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the \\nonset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in \\nUkraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp \\nincrease in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment \\nportfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions \\nand high volatility. The effects of the global developments on \\ninvestments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see \\nNote 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized \\ncost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement \\nThe financial statements of t he General Department are \\nprepared in accordance with International Financial \\nReporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International \\nAccounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial \\nstatements have been prepared under the historical cost \\nconvention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments \\nat fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements \\nhave also been prepared on t he basis that the General \\nDepartment will continue to op erate as a going concern. \\n2.1  Unit of account \\nThe financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the \\nIMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined \\ndaily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket \\ncurrencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition \\nof the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These \\nreviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of \\ncurrencies), determine the relative weights of those \\ncurrencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are \\nused to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the \\ncurrencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30, \\n2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows: \\nSDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount \\nChinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174 \\nEuro 30.93 0.38671 \\nJapanese yen 8.33 11.900 \\nPound sterling 8.09 0.085946 \\nUS dollar  41.73 0.58252 \\n \\nAt April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430 \\n(US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021). \\nThe current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled \\nto expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive \\nBoard decided to extend it to July 31, 2022. \\nOn May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the \\nquinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR \\nand agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR \\ncurrency and interest rate baskets and approved their \\nupdated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, \\naccordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, \\nthe euro, and the Japanese yen.  \\nEffective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket \\nwill be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent) \\nChinese renminbi 12.28 \\nEuro 29.31 \\nJapanese yen 7.59 \\nPound sterling 7.44 \\nUS dollar  43.38 \\n \\nThe amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated \\non July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the \\nnew weights. The next review of the method of valuation of \\nthe SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the \\ninterim justify an earlier review.  \\n2.2  SDR interest rate \\nThe SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges \\nlevied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR \\nholdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’ \\nreserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on \\nborrowings (see Note 14).  \\nThe SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a \\nweighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments \\nin the money markets of the members whose currencies are \\nincluded in the SDR valuation basket:  \\nSDR basket currency Yield or rate \\nChinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China \\nTreasury bonds as published by the China \\nCentral Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. \\nEuro Three-month spot rate for euro area central \\ngovernment bonds with a minimum rating of \\nAA published by the European Central \\nBank \\nJapanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills \\nPound sterling Three-month Treasury bills \\nUS dollar Three-month Treasury bills \\n \\nThe SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent \\nand is rounded to three decimal places.  \\nThe average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum \\nand 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years \\nended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\n2.3  Use of estimates and judgement \\nThe preparation of financ ial statements requires \\nmanagement to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies \\nand the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an \\nongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised \\nand in any future periods affected. \\nThe most significant estimates and judgements used in \\napplying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn \\ncommitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value \\nmeasurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and \\n8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3). \\n3.  Summary of significant accounting policies \\n3.1  Financial instruments  \\nFinancial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7. \\nMeasurement at initial recognition \\nFinancial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \\nthe instrument. The General Department uses settlement \\ndate accounting for all financial instruments except for \\ninvestments, which are accounted for using trade date \\naccounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best \\nevidenced by the transaction amount.  \\nDerecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when \\nthe contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the \\nassets have expired, or when they have been transferred and \\neither: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all \\nthe risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General \\nDepartment neither transfers nor retains substantially all the \\nrisks and rewards of ownership but the General Department \\nhas not retained control.  \\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when they are \\nextinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged, \\ncanceled, or expires).  \\nClassification and subsequent measurement of \\nfinancial assets \\nA financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial \\nasset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.  \\nFinancial assets that are held for collection of contractual \\ncash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized \\ncost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is \\nincluded in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is \\nrecognized in the statements of income.  \\nFinancial assets that are held for collection of contractual \\ncash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows \\nrepresent solely payments of principal and interest, would be \\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income \\n(FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial \\nassets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\nAll other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be \\nmeasured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with \\nchanges in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment \\nAt each reporting date, the General Department assesses on \\na forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL) \\nassociated with its financial assets at AC and with the \\nundrawn balances under its lending commitments. The \\nmeasurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating \\na range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is \\navailable without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.  \\nIf the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they \\nwould be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.  \\nShould any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest \\nincome would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment \\nallowance). \\nClassification and subsequent measurement of \\nfinancial liabilities \\nDerivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.  \\nAll other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.  \\n3.2  Financial assets \\n3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’ \\ncurrencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in \\nthe form of account balances or non-interest-bearing \\npromissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on \\ndemand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 15 \\uf0b7 Usable currencies are currencies of members considered \\nto be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can \\nbe used to finance GRA transactions with other members.  \\n\\uf0b7 Currencies of members that are not considered to have a \\nsufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves \\nposition to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own \\ncurrencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note \\n3.2.1.1).  \\nThe currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency \\nrevaluations (see Note 5). \\n3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges \\nCredit outstanding is a financial asset that represents \\nfinancing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing \\nin the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in \\nexchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by \\nmembers by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in \\nexchange for SDRs or usable currencies.  \\nCharges and fees \\nThe GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on \\nmembers’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method. \\n \\nIn addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant \\nlevel-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding \\nset by the Executive Board are reached.  \\nCharges not received from members within the required \\ntimeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden-\\nsharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate \\nof charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of \\nremuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see \\nNote 13.1).  \\nA service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from \\nthe GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized \\nas income upon payment.  \\nA commitment fee is levied on the amount available for \\nfinancing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of \\nthe arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment \\nfees are refunded as the member makes purchases under \\nthe relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also \\nrefunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are \\nrecognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of \\nfinancial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment \\nfee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly, \\ncommitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis \\nover the duration of the SLL arrangement. \\nImpairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of \\nthe IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.  \\n\\uf0b7 IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic \\npolicies that the member commits to in order to overcome \\nbalance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.  \\n\\uf0b7 The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1). \\n\\uf0b7 The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which \\nhas been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors. \\nTaken together, these factor s significantly reduce the \\nlikelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.  \\nThe General Department has not recognized any impairment \\nlosses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions \\nin the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to \\nits member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances \\nvarying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk \\nassessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the \\nGeneral Department.  \\nSimilarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit \\nrisk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its \\nunique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not \\ncomparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial \\nfinancial entities and, as a cooperative member organization, \\nthe IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating \\ngrades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is \\nassessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative \\nconsiderations pertaining to each debtor member, such as \\nthe status of the economic programs underlying IMF \\nfinancing, the member’s cooperation on policy \\nimplementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s \\ncapacity to repay. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL \\nestimation based on changes in credit quality since initial \\nrecognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1, \\nStage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk \\nhas increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on \\na lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been \\nno significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition \\n(Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL \\nthat result from default events possible within the next \\n12 months. \\nThe key judgements and assumptions adopted by the \\nGeneral Department in t he measurement of ECL are \\ndiscussed below\\n: \\n(i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired  \\nThe General Department considers a member country to be \\nin default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its \\nfinancial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days \\npast due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the \\nthreshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation \\nhas defaulted.  \\n(ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member \\nbasis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date \\nwith the risk of default at t he date of the most recent \\ndisbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is \\nperformed on each reporting date and takes into account a \\nrange of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including \\noverdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by \\nthe member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant \\nincreases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for \\nappropriateness at least annually.  \\nThe assessment does not rely on any single factor and may, \\non the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the \\npresumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due. \\nDuring the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted \\narrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled \\n(see Note 5.2). \\n(iii) Low credit risk  \\nThe General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.  \\nCredit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet \\nits contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in \\nthe longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the \\nability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow \\nobligations.  \\n(iv) Measuring ECL \\nECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash \\nshortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate \\nof charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of \\npossible outcomes in light of expected future economic \\nconditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of \\neach outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.  \\nFor the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and \\noperations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing \\nmechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to \\noverdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special \\nContingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the \\nultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2). \\nWrite-off \\nIn the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding \\nobligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no \\nprospects of recovering amounts due to the General \\nDepartment in the foreseeable future, the IMF would \\nrecognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be \\nwritten off.  \\n3.2.2  SDR holdings  \\nSDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6). \\nSDR holdings are measured at AC. \\nInterest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective \\ninterest method.  \\n3.2.3  Investments  \\nInvestments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private \\ninfrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term \\ninvestments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in \\nthe statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in \\naccordance with their respective investment strategy (see \\nNote 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value \\nbasis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities \\nare classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in \\naccordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in \\nfixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost. \\nPurchases and sales of investments are recognized on the \\ntrade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable \\nor payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities, \\nrespectively, pending settlement of a transaction. \\nInvestment income compri ses interest income on \\ninvestments at AC, interest and dividend income, and \\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising \\nfrom exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all \\ntrading-related fees. \\nInterest income from investments is recognized using the \\neffective interest method. Dividend income is recognized \\nbased on the ex-dividend date. \\n3.3  Cash and cash equivalents  \\nUsable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows. \\n3.4  Gold holdings \\nGold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of \\nthe IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at \\nhistorical cost using the spec ific identification method. The \\ncarrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of \\nthe IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the \\nsale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was \\nheld on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second \\nAmendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion \\nof the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in \\nthe GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount \\nof the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold \\nholdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to \\nthe historical cost. \\n3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nassets \\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are \\nmeasured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nassets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the \\nestimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other \\nproperty, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold \\nimprovements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease \\nagreement. Software is amortized over three to five years. \\n3.6  Post-employment benefits \\nThe IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other \\npost-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance \\nbenefits (see Note 11). \\nThe net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan \\nrecognized in the statements of financial position is the \\npresent value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair \\nvalue of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive \\nincome. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by \\ndiscounting the estimated future cash outflows using market \\nyields on high-quality corporate bonds.  \\nNet periodic pension cost includes service cost and net \\ninterest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement \\nbenefit plans. \\n3.7  Financial liabilities \\n3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to \\naccumulate precautionary balances under the burden-\\nsharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit \\ndefault. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.  \\n3.7.2  Borrowings  \\nBorrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing \\nreceived under the various borrowing arrangements \\n(see Note 14). \\nInterest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the \\neffective interest method.  \\n3.7.3  Quota subscriptions  \\nMembers’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that \\nrepresent subscription payments by members, including \\npayments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member \\nbecomes effective when the member both consents to the \\nquota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific \\nquota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a \\nquarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination of I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the \\nmember’s own currency.  \\nQuota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the \\nstatements of financial position, as they embody an \\nunconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s \\nwithdrawal from the IMF. \\n3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration \\nA member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in \\nexchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s \\ncurrency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see \\nNote 15.2).  \\nThe GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a \\nremunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche \\nposition (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized \\non an accrual basis.  \\n3.8  Provisions \\nProvisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is \\nprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at \\nthe present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be \\npaid to settle the obligations. \\n3.9  Foreign currency translation \\nTransactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are \\nrecorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the \\ntransaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the \\ndate of the financial statements. Exchange differences \\narising from the settlement of transactions at rates different \\nfrom those at the originating date of the transactions are \\nincluded in the determination of net income. \\n3.10  Fair value measurement \\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between \\nmarket participants at the m easurement date. A fair value \\nmeasurement is based on th e presumption that the \\ntransaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most \\nadvantageous market. \\nA three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair \\nvalue under which financial instruments are categorized \\nbased on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset \\nor liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level \\nwithin which the fair value me asurement is categorized is \\nbased on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair \\nvalue measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a \\nLevel 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are \\nboth observable and unobservable. Transfers in and out of \\nthe fair value hierarchy levels  are recognized at the end of \\nthe reporting period. \\nThe valuation techniques used to determine fair value are \\ndescribed in Note 8. \\n3.11  Amendments to existing standards that became \\neffective in the financial year ended April 30, 2022 \\nAmendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, and IFRS 7, \\n“Financial Instruments: Disclosures” were issued in August 2020 to address financial reporting issues related to the \\nreform of an interest rate benchmark, including its \\nreplacement with alternative benchmark rates. The \\namendments are effective for annual periods starting on or \\nafter January 1, 2021, and were adopted by the General \\nDepartment on May 1, 2021.

Financial risk management  \\nThe General Department is exposed to various types of \\noperational and financial risks, including credit, market, and \\nliquidity risks. \\n4.1  Risk management framework \\nBy virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of \\nAgreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk \\nacceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and \\nassessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management. \\n\\uf0b7 Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by \\nestablishing and main taining a system of internal controls. \\n\\uf0b7 A risk management function is responsible for developing \\nand maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and \\nreporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile, \\nhighlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.  \\n\\uf0b7 An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of \\ngovernance and internal control processes.  \\n Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor \\nand make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the \\ncycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.  \\n4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than \\ninvestments \\nFinancial assets and liabilities other than investments are \\nexposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than \\ninvestments \\nCredit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any \\nof the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and \\nundrawn committed amounts under approved financing \\ncommitments. \\nCredit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the \\ninternational monetary system  because the IMF has limited \\nability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides \\nfinancing when other sources of credit are not available to a \\nmember. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance \\nprovided to its member countries. \\nMeasures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing \\narrangements include program design and conditionality, \\nwhich serve to help member countries solve their balance of \\npayments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the \\nmember will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments, \\nsurcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for \\ndealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden-\\nsharing mechanism (see Note 13).  \\nThe IMF has established limits on overall access to \\nresources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to \\nSLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally \\nset at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative \\nlimit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled \\nrepurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual \\nlimit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota \\nannually for the period from July 13, 2020, through \\nDecember 31, 2021.  \\nAccess in excess of these limits can be granted in \\nexceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements, \\nthere is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in \\naccordance with the policy framework on exceptional access. \\nThe IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of \\npayments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its \\nability to regain access to financing from other sources, the \\nmember’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of \\npolicies to be adopted.  \\nPLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of \\n500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access \\nunder a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of \\n125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience \\nlarger short-term balance of payments needs due to the I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional \\nor global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL \\narrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of \\nquota. \\nSLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple \\npurchases and repurchases may take place during the \\ncourse of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent \\nof quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.  \\nFurther, in September 2020, the IMF established policy \\nsafeguards when a member requests financing with \\ncombined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified \\nthresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that \\ntrigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework. \\nThe safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and \\nprocedures applied in the GRA exceptional access \\nframework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to \\nSeptember 2020. \\nThe annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50 \\npercent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100 \\npercent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases). \\nThese limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of \\nquota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of \\nscheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020, \\nthrough June 30, 2023. \\nPurchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in \\ntranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural \\nbenchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by \\nthe Executive Board.  \\nIn addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to \\nmitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance \\nagainst any conditions under an IMF-supported program. \\nSafeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance \\nthat the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control, \\nreporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including \\nIMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as \\ndirect budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at \\nthe central bank, and that an appropriate framework \\nagreement between the central bank and the government be \\nin place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial \\nobligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.  \\nThe maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.  \\n4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding \\nCredit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and \\nSDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively \\n(see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by \\nregion was as follows:\\n \\n \\nThe use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as \\nfollows: \\n \\nThe five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine, \\nPakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is \\npresented in Schedule 1. \\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number \\nof countries have benefited from emergency financial \\nassistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21 \\ncountries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million \\nthat did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March \\n31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited. \\n4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments \\nUndrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted \\nto SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30, \\n2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in \\nSchedule 3.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the \\nExecutive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022 \\n(SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).  \\nThe undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have \\nalso increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see \\nNote 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries \\nthat had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit \\noutstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented \\nexisting lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new \\nneeds arising from the impact of the pandemic. \\n4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than \\ninvestments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows \\nof financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in \\nmarket prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and \\nexchange rate risk. \\n4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk \\nInterest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will \\nfluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments \\nof the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR \\ninterest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate \\n(see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by \\nlinking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR \\ninterest rate).  \\n4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk \\nExchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s \\nfinancial position and cash flows will be affected by \\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  \\n\\uf0b7 The General Department has no exchange rate risk \\nexposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such \\nholdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).  \\n\\uf0b7 The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes \\nadministrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these \\nactivities is limited.  \\n\\uf0b7 The General Department has no exchange rate exposure \\nfrom its current borrowing arrangements because all \\ndrawings are denominated in SDRs. \\n4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments \\nLiquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of \\nnonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of \\nmembers and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF \\nfinancing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a \\nrevolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of \\ncredit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand \\nready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for \\nexample, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of \\nneed, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s \\nreserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New \\nArrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing \\nagreements (see Note 14). \\nThe IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing \\ndevelopments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity \\nmeasure—Forward Commitment Capacity\\n-represents the \\nIMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its \\nmembers over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).  \\nLong-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the \\nadequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of \\nmembers’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to \\nevaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet \\nmembers’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14). \\nShort-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed \\nand approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis \\nthrough a financial transactions plan for quota resources and \\nthe resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.  \\n4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other \\nthan investments \\nDepending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase \\nperiods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled \\nand overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are \\nsummarized below: \\n \\n \\nRepayments of outstanding borrowings are determined \\naccording to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was \\nfinanced by borrowed resources. They also take into account \\nthe maximum maturity of outstanding borrowings, which was  April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021  \\nFinancial year (in millions of SDRs ) \\n2022 —  8,961 \\n2023 19,198  19,777 \\n2024 23,252  24,006 \\n2025  18,497  18,183 \\n2026 9,494  7,842 \\n2027 6,446  3,692 \\n2028 and beyond 16,144  7,185 \\nOverdue —  142 \\nTotal 93,031  89,788 \\nI. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n22 equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled \\nrepayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized \\nbelow: \\n \\nRepurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, \\nand 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively. \\nThese advance repurchases resulted in earlier than \\nscheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively. \\nFuture interest payments on borrowings calculated at the \\nSDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total \\nof SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date. \\nUsable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates. \\n4.3  Investments \\nInvestments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. \\n4.3.1  Credit risk on investments \\nCredit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if \\nissuers and counterparties were to default on their \\ncontractual obligations.  \\nCredit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income \\ninvestments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the \\ntime of acquisition: \\n\\uf0b7 For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12, \\n2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of \\nBBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale) \\nfor corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).  \\n\\uf0b7 For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for \\ncorporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate \\nbonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB– \\nare permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the \\nInvestment Account. \\n\\uf0b7 Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments \\nissued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), \\nwhich does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits, \\nand short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit \\nrisk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the \\nend of the respective reporting periods, was as follows: \\n Fixed-Income Subaccount  \\n April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 \\n(as a percentage of total investments in \\nfixed-income instruments)  \\nNot rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6% \\nAAA  5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2% \\nAA+ to AA–  7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0% \\nA+ to A  5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4% \\nBBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8% \\nTotal  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0% \\n \\n \\nCounterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and \\ncollateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk \\nfor derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized \\ngains on such contracts.  \\nThe credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the \\nFixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and \\nSDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The \\ncredit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and \\nSDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\n4.3.2  Market risk on investments \\nMarket risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows \\nof financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in \\nmarket prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest \\nrate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks. \\nThe investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and \\nEndowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment \\nstrategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are \\ntailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them \\nto different types of market risk.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount \\nThe Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a \\nbroad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and \\nRegulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class \\ndiversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.  \\nThe Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of \\nderivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio \\nbalancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage. \\nExchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments \\ndenominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income \\nSubaccount’s SDR basket composition. \\n4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount  \\nInvestments are divided into eight categories, which are \\nsubject to varying market risks and benefits from \\ndiversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible \\ninvestments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class \\ndiversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.  \\nEffective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to \\nemerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed \\npassively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment \\nSubaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation \\nand the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up \\nto 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same \\nasset categories with target  shares for fixed-income \\ninstruments and equities with out specific allocation \\nrequirements within those shares).  \\nThe Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative \\ninstruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing, \\nbenchmark replication, and market access.  \\nBecause the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in \\nUS dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general \\nobjective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see \\nNote 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is \\nmeasured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations \\nof the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk \\nfor fixed-income instruments denominated in developed \\nmarket currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.  \\n4.3.2.3  Value at risk \\nExposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which \\nconsiders known market risks in each of the asset categories \\nand the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates \\nreported below represent the maximum potential loss in \\nvalue of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market \\nmovements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a \\n1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount. \\nThe VaR model is based on historical simulations with a \\nthree-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios \\nto produce plausible future scenarios based on these \\nsimulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations \\nand each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical \\nempirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard \\nmethodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many \\nassumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different \\nassumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.  \\nThe VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as \\nfollows: \\n April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs ) \\nTranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65 \\nTranche 2 (see Note 7) 107 58 \\nDiversification effects (26) (47) \\nTotal Fixed-Income Subaccount 250 76 \\n I.

These risks are balanced a gainst the need \\nto meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset \\nallocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the \\nInvestment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is \\ndesigned to minimize the level of portfolio market risk \\n(volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning \\nportfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’ \\nliabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment \\napproach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of \\nreturn, because asset class returns are not perfectly \\ncorrelated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific, \\ntargeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategies I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or \\nduration matching. \\nThe primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have \\nsufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the \\nparticipants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings \\nof cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans. \\n4.5  Precautionary balances \\nPrecautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the \\n2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the \\nEndowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1. \\nThey are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk \\nmanagement framework as they provide a buffer to protect \\nthe Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit, \\nincome, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of \\nprecautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the \\nstandard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring \\ndue to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy \\nlinked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive \\nBoard kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum \\nfloor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative \\ntarget had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion \\nduring the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020). \\nDuring the December 2021 interim review, the Executive \\nBoard approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary \\nbalances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic \\nand financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as \\nthe ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans \\nis measured using a discount rate that reflects the\\n expected \\nlong-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability \\ncalculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net \\nasset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect \\nfrom May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date, \\nreflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.  \\nAt April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances \\namounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion, \\nrespectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs) \\nSpecial Reserve (Note 16)  13,692 11,347 \\nGeneral Reserve (Note 16) 12,832 12,003 \\nExcluding profits from gold sales (4,403) (4,403) \\nAdjustment for net assets/liabilities under \\nretirement benefit plans under \\nIAS 19 (Note 11.2) (1,248) n/a \\nAdjustment for net liabilities \\nunder retirement benefit plans \\nunder the economic basis —1 n/a  \\nSCA-1 (Note 13.2)   — 1,066 \\nTotal precautionary balances 20,873 20,013 \\n1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis \\nresulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to \\nprecautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19. \\n5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding \\nUnder the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are \\nrequired to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their \\ncurrencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or \\nappreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives \\nrise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of \\nthe financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF \\nor the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at \\nApril 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising \\nfrom those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and \\nSDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of \\nSDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables \\nand payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million, \\nrespectively). \\nAll holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at \\nthe IMF’s financial year-end.  \\n5.1  Credit outstanding \\nAt April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit \\nwas represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million \\nand SDR 89,788 million, respectively. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of \\nthe GRA were as follows: \\n1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary \\nFinancing Facility. \\n \\n1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary \\nFinancing Facility. \\n \\n5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance \\nThe tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI \\nthat was provided by the General Department to members \\nfacing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the \\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit \\noutstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1. \\nFollowing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access \\nlimits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see \\nNote 4.2.1). \\n5.1.2  Impairment analysis \\nThe General Department has performed an impairment \\nanalysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL \\nmodel (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss \\nallowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022, \\nand 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding \\ntakes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing \\nand its institutional status, and is performed holistically for \\neach debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative \\nconsiderations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the \\nresults of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and \\n2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in \\ninput parameters of the ECL calculation. \\n5.2  Overdue obligations \\nAt April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General \\nDepartment (one member—Sudan—was six months or more \\noverdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).  \\nOn June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue \\nobligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and \\nSDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue \\ncharges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected \\nthrough burden-sharing adjustments to charges and \\nremuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).  \\n6.  SDR holdings \\nThe General Department can receive SDRs from members in \\nthe settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and \\nquota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use \\nor receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to \\nmembers, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on \\nborrowings to member countries and lenders. \\nAt April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General \\nDepartment amounted to SDR 22,270 million and \\nSDR 22,203 million, respectively. \\nThe GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate \\nas other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during \\nthe financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million, \\nrespectively. \\n7.

Fair value measurement  \\nValuation techniques used to value financial instruments \\ninclude the following: \\nLevel 1 \\nThe fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on \\nquoted market prices in an active market for identical assets \\nwithout any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and \\nderivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income \\nsecurities). These investments are included within Level 1 of \\nthe fair value hierarchy.  \\nLevel 2 The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of \\nsignificant observable market information, such  as recently \\nexecuted trades in securities of the issuer or comparable \\nissuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into \\naccount the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable, \\nthese securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value \\nhierarchy.  \\nThe fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments \\n(foreign exchange forwards, curr ency/interest rate swaps) not \\nactively traded is determined using a pricing model that \\nincorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves. Given that  the significant inputs into the \\npricing models are market obser vable, these instruments are \\nincluded within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \\nLevel 3 \\nThe private infrastructure debt assets classified within Level \\n3 have significant unobserva ble inputs, as they trade \\ninfrequently or do not trade at all. As observable prices are \\nnot available for these assets, the mark-to-model valuation \\ntechnique is used to derive the fair value. Different assumptions or approximations could produce significantly \\ndifferent valuation estimates.  \\n8.1  Investments  \\nThe following tables present the fair value hierarchy used to \\ndetermine the fair value of investments in the IA: \\n April 30, 2022  \\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total \\n(in millions of SDRs)  \\nRecurring fair value measurements   \\nFixed-Income Subaccount 133 18,702 — 18,835 \\nEndowment Subaccount 3,270 3,216 97 6,583 \\nTotal 3,403 21,918 97 25,418 \\n \\n April 30, 2021  \\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total \\n(in millions of SDRs)  \\nRecurring fair value measurements   \\nFixed-Income Subaccount 194 15,661 — 15,855 \\nEndowment Subaccount 2,707 3,707 12 6,426 \\nTotal 2,901 19,368 12 22,281 \\n \\nDuring the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments totaling SDR 11 million in the Endowment Subaccount were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (there were no transfers \\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 in the Fixed-Income Subaccount). \\nThese investments relate to equity securities where trading was either inactive or quoted prices in the applicable market \\nwere not observable as at April 30, 2022. Quoted prices for \\nsimilar securities directly observable in an alternative market \\nwere used for fair value measurement of these securities as \\nat April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 in both \\nthe Fixed-Income and Endowment Subaccounts.   \\nThere were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 of fair value \\nhierarchy in both the Fixed-Income and Endowment \\nSubaccounts during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, \\nand 2021. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n30 Fixed-term deposits in the IA are generally of a short-term \\nnature and are carried at amorti zed cost, which approximates \\nfair value. \\nDerivative liabilities at April 30, 2022 comprised \\nSDR 16 million valued based on quoted market prices \\n(Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and SDR 76 million \\nvalued based on observable market data (Level 2 in the fair \\nvalue hierarchy) (SDR 8 million and SDR 48 million for \\nLevel 1 and Level 2, respectively, at April 30, 2021). \\n8.2  Credit outstanding  \\nThe IMF plays a unique role in providing balance of \\npayments support to member countries. IMF financing \\nfeatures policy conditions that  require member countries to \\nimplement macroeconomic and structural policies and are an \\nintegral part of IMF financing. These measures aim to help \\ncountries resolve their balanc e of payments problems while \\nsafeguarding IMF resources. The fair value of IMF credit \\noutstanding cannot be deter mined due to its unique \\ncharacteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, and the absence of a principal or \\nmost advantageous market for IMF credit.  \\n8.3  Other financial assets and liabilities  \\nThe carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities that \\nare classified at AC represents a reasonable estimate of their \\nfair value at April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\n9.  Gold holdings  \\nThe IMF acquired its gold holdings from quota subscriptions and financial transactions prior to the entry into force of the \\nSecond Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement \\n(April 1, 1978). At April 30,  2022, and 2021, the IMF held \\ngold of 2,814 metric tons, equal to 90.474 million fine troy ounces, at designated depositories. Gold holdings were valued at a historical cost of SDR 3,167 million at April 30, \\n2022, and 2021, based on a cost of SDR 35 per fine troy ounce. \\nAt April 30, 2022, the market value of the IMF’s holdings of \\ngold was SDR 128.6 billion (SDR 111.4 billion at \\nApril 30, 2021).  \\n10.

The pension plans also provide an option for eligible staff \\nto receive reduced pension be nefits beginning at the age of \\n50. The level of pension benefits depends on the participants’ length of service and highest three-year average pensionable gross compensation. Participants may also elect upon \\nretirement to commute a portion of the lifetime pension \\nbenefits into a lump-sum payment. \\nOn June 3, 2021, the Executiv e Board approved changes to \\nthe SRP and SRBP with an effect ive date of May 1, 2022, to \\nupdate the formula for the co mputation of the pensionable \\ngross compensation. The amount of past service cost \\nresulting from these changes recognized in the statement of income for the year ended April 30, 2022, amounted to \\nnegative SDR 57 million.  \\nThe IMF provides other non-pension long-term benefits, \\nincluding medical insurance, life insurance, separation and \\nrepatriation benefits, accrued annual leave, and associated \\ntax allowances. The IMF has established a separate account, the Retired Staff Benefits Investment Account (RSBIA), to \\nhold and invest resources set asid e to fund the cost of certain \\npost-retirement benefits.  \\nIn May 2020, the Executive Board approved changes to \\nseparation and repatriation benef its with an effective date of \\nOctober 1, 2020. The past servic e cost resulting from these \\nchanges recognized in the stat ement of income for the year \\nended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 6 million. In April 2022, the Executive Board ap proved changes to medical \\nbenefits covered by the RSBI A with an effective date of \\nJanuary 1, 2023. The past service cost resulting from these changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year \\nended April 30, 2022 was a gain of SDR 112 million. \\nThe assets in the SRP, SRBP, and RSBIA (collectively, the \\nPlans) are held separately from  the assets of all other \\naccounts of the IMF. Also, the net asset position in one of the \\nPlans cannot be netted with the net liability position in \\nanother Plan. In the event the IMF were to exercise its right \\nto terminate the Plans, the assets of these plans would be used to satisfy liabilities to par ticipants, retired participants, \\nand their beneficiaries and other liabilities of the pension plans. Any remaining assets would be returned to the GRA. The GRA meets the costs of administering the Plans, and the \\nSRP and RSBIA reimburse the GRA for investment-related \\ncosts.  \\nThe Executive Board and t he Pension Committee are \\nresponsible for the governance of the Plans. The Executive \\nBoard approves the funding framework and amendments to \\nthe Plans. The Pension Committ ee, consisting of members of \\nthe Executive Board a nd senior staff, super vises and controls \\nthe overall administration of  the SRP and the SRBP. The \\nPension Committee also undert akes periodic valuations of the assets and liabilities related to the Plans and advises the \\nExecutive Board on the appropri ate funding framework. It is \\nsupported by an Investment Committee to oversee the investments of the Plans. \\n11.2  Net assets/liabilities and benefit costs under \\nretirement benefit plans \\nThe amounts recognized in the statements of financial \\nposition were as follows: \\n April 30, 2022 April 30, \\n2021 \\n Pension \\nbenefits Other \\nemployee \\nbenefits Total  \\nTotal \\n  (in millions of SDRs)  \\nDefined benefit \\nobligation (8,610) (1,856) (10,466) (11,425) \\nPlan assets 9,404 2,310 11,714 11,220 \\nNet assets 794 581 1,375 — \\nNet liabilities  — (127) (127) (205) \\n \\nThe amounts recognized in the statements of income and \\nstatements of comprehensive income were as follows: \\n 2022 2021 \\n Pension \\nbenefits Other \\nemployee \\nbenefits Total Total \\n  (in millions of SDRs)  \\nService cost (262) (105) (367) (407) \\nPast service cost 57 112 169 (6) \\nInterest expense related to \\ndefined benefit obligation (280) (71) (351) (335) \\nInterest income related to plan assets 271 65 336 244 \\nNet periodic pension cost \\nrecognized in the statements of income (214) 1 (213) (504) \\nRemeasurement of defined benefit obligation 1,405 630 2,035 457 \\nNet return on plan assets excluding amounts included in interest income (393) (94) (487) 2,532 \\nExchange differences (19) (14) (33) 166 \\nAmounts recognized in other comprehensive income 993 522 1,515 3,155 \\nTotal gain recognized in \\nstatements of \\ncomprehensive income 779 523 1,302 2,651 \\n I.

Burden-sharing and the Special Contingent \\nAccount \\n13.1  Burden-sharing for deferred charges  \\nThe IMF has adopted a burden-sharing mechanism to \\naddress the financial consequences of member countries’ \\nfailure to settle financial obligations to the GRA on time. \\nUnder the burden-sharing mechanism, resources are generated by increasing the rate of charge paid by borrowers \\nand reducing the rate of remuneration paid to creditor \\nmembers to cover shortfalls in the GRA’s income due to the \\nnonpayment of charges.  \\nMembers that participated in  burden-sharing for overdue \\ncharges receive refunds to the extent that t hese charges are \\nsubsequently settled by the defaulting member. During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the General \\nDepartment refunded the full amount of remaining burden-\\nsharing adjustments amounting to SDR 611 million resulting \\nfrom the settlement of all outstanding overdue GRA charges \\npreviously deferred (see Note 5.2). There were no deferred charges at April 30, 2022. \\nThere were no burden-sharing refunds during the financial \\nyear ended April 30, 2021. Overdue charges that resulted in \\nadjustments to charges and remuneration for the year ended \\nApril 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see Note 17). Cumulative overdue charges that resulted in adjustments to \\ncharges and remuneration since May 1, 1986 (the date the \\nburden-sharing mechanism was adopted) amounted to SDR 2,051 million at April 30, 2021. The cumulative refunds \\nfor the same period, resulting from the settlements of \\noverdue charges for which burden-sharing adjustments had \\nbeen made, amounted to SDR 1,440 million at \\nApril 30, 2021.  \\n13.2  Burden-sharing for the SCA-1 \\nThe burden-sharing mechanism has also financed additions \\nto the SCA-1, which offers protection against the risk of loss \\nresulting from the ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA.  \\nContributions to the SCA-1 are to be returned when there are \\nno outstanding overdue repurchases and charges, or at such earlier time as the Executive Board may decide. \\nDuring the financial year ended April 30, 2022, in connection \\nwith the clearance of Sudan’ s arrears to the IMF, the \\nExecutive Board decided to make a distribution of the remaining SDR 1,066 million in the SCA-1 to contributing members. The distribution took place on June 29, 2021, and \\nthe SCA-1 balance amounted to zero at April 30, 2022 \\n(SDR 1,066 million at April 30, 2021). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n34 Effective November 1, 2006, t he Executive Board decided to \\nsuspend, for the time being, further additions to the SCA-1. \\nAccordingly, no additions have been made to the SCA-1 \\nduring the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  \\n14.  Borrowings \\nThe GRA can borrow to temporarily supplement its quota \\nresources. The Executive Boar d has established guidelines \\non borrowing by the GRA to ensur e that the financing of the \\nGRA is managed in a prudent and systemic manner.  \\nThe GRA’s main standing borrowing arrangement is the \\nNAB. The GRA may also borrow under bilateral agreements, in particular loan and note purchase agreements (bilateral \\nborrowing agreements). At April 30, 2022, the NAB credit \\narrangements amounted to SDR 360.8 billion and the bilateral borrowing agreements amounted to \\nSDR 138.1 billion; see Schedules 4 and 5, respectively. \\n14.1  New Arrangements to Borrow  \\nThe NAB is a standing set of credit arrangements with 40 participants, of which 38 ag reements were effective at \\nApril 30, 2022, and 2021. The NAB provides supplementary \\nresources to the GRA as a second line of defense to IMF \\nquotas.  \\nNAB periods are renewed periodically. In January 2020, the \\nExecutive Board approved a NAB reform that doubled NAB \\ncommitments and set a new NAB period through end 2025. \\nNAB participants have since provided the necessary consents and this reform took effect as targeted on January \\n1, 2021. Following the effect iveness of the reform, the \\neffective NAB commitments amounted to 360.8 billion at April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\nNAB resources can be activated when the Fund’s resources \\nneed to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an \\nimpairment of the internat ional monetary system. The \\nactivation requires the consent of participants representing \\n85 percent of total NAB credit  arrangements of participants \\neligible to vote and the approval  of the Executive Board. The \\nNAB was not activated at April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\nDrawings under the NAB can be made to finance purchases \\nby borrowing members for outright purchases and under \\narrangements that were approved during the period when the NAB was activated. Claims under the NAB are encashable \\non demand by participants, subject to certain conditions. \\n14.2  Bilateral Borrowing Agreements  \\nBilateral borrowing agreements are intended to serve as a third line of defense to IMF quotas and NAB resources. The \\ncurrent round of bilateral borrowing agreements, which have been in effect since January 1, 2021, were signed under a framework established by the Executive Board in 2020. They \\nhave an initial term through end-December 2023, which may \\nbe extended by one more year, subject to creditor consent.  \\nAt April 30, 2022, lenders’  commitments under effective \\nborrowing agreements totaled US$185.6 billion, equivalent to \\nSDR 138.1 billion (US$193.9 billion equivalent to \\nSDR 135.0 billion at April 30, 2021).  \\nResources under bilateral borrowing agreements can be \\nactivated only if the amount  of IMF resources otherwise \\navailable for financing has fallen below a threshold of SDR 100 billion and either the NAB is activated or there are no available uncommitted NAB resources. Activation requires \\napproval by bilateral creditors r epresenting 85 percent of the \\ntotal credit amount committed.  \\nDrawings under the borrowing agreements may be made to \\nfinance purchases by borrowing members for outright \\npurchases and under arrangements that were approved during the period when the borrowing agreements were \\nactivated. Claims under the bilateral borrowing agreements \\nare encashable on demand by lenders, subject to certain conditions. \\n14.3  Outstanding borrowings \\nOutstanding borrowings represent  drawings under the NAB, \\nare denominated in SDRs, and carry the SDR interest rate. There were no outstanding borrowings under bilateral \\nborrowing agreements at April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\nThere were no drawings under the NAB or bilateral \\nborrowings during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, \\nand 2021. Repayments under the NAB during the same periods amounted to SDR 2,523 million and \\nSDR 3,765 million, respectively. Total outstanding NAB \\nborrowings at April 30, 2022, and 2021, were SDR 2,615 \\nmillion and SDR 5,138 million, respectively (see Schedule 4).  \\nThe average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was \\n0.107 percent per annum and 0.077 percent per annum for \\nthe financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, \\nrespectively.  The interest expense on outstanding borrowings \\nduring the same periods was SDR 4 million and \\nSDR 6 million, respectively. \\n15.  Quota subscriptions and reserve tranche \\npositions \\n15.1  Quota subscriptions \\nThe IMF’s resources are primarily provided by its members \\nthrough the payment of quota subscriptions, which broadly I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 35 reflect each member’s relative position in the global \\neconomy. Quotas also determine each member’s relative \\nvoting power, its share in SDR allocations, and its access to \\nIMF resources.  \\nThe IMF conducts a general review of members’ quotas at \\nintervals of not more than five years. The review allows the \\nIMF to assess the adequacy of quota resources to meet its \\nneeds and to allow for adjustments to members’ quotas to \\nreflect their relative positions in the world economy.  \\nThe Fourteenth General Review of Quotas became effective \\nin January 2016. At April 30, 2022, 187 members had \\nconsented and paid in full their quota increases, amounting to SDR 238 billion (184 members at April 30, 2021, \\namounting to SDR 238 billion) . This amount represents over \\n99 percent of the total quota increases that members were \\neligible for at January 26, 2016 (SDR 239 billion). Quota subscription payments under the Fourteenth General Review \\nof Quotas during the years e nded April 30, 2022, and 2021, \\namounted to SDR 0.5 billion and SDR 2 million, respectively. \\nThe Fifteenth General Review of  Quotas was concluded in \\nFebruary 2020 with no increase in IMF quotas. The Sixteenth \\nReview is planned to be concluded no later than \\nDecember 15, 2023. \\nOn October 16, 2020, the Princi pality of Andorra became the \\n190\\nth member of the IMF wit h an initial quota of \\nSDR 83 million, which was paid in full during the financial \\nyear ended April 30, 2021. \\n15.2  Reserve tranche positions \\nThe reserve tranche is determined as the difference between the member’s quota subscription and the GRA’s holdings of its currency, excluding holdings that reflect the member’s use \\nof GRA credit and administrative balances. A member’s \\nreserve tranche is also considered a part of its international \\nreserves and a liquid claim against the GRA that can be \\nencashed by the member at any time upon the representation of a balance of payments need. \\n \\nMembers’ reserve tranche positions were as follows:  \\n April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs ) \\nQuota subscriptions 476,272 475,808 \\nTotal currency holdings 454,718 458,656 \\nLess: GRA credit outstanding (93,031) (89,788) \\nLess: administrative balances (161) (167) \\n 361,526 368,701 \\nReserve tranche positions 114,746 107,107 \\n16.  Reserves of the General Resources Account \\n16.1  Reserves of the General Resources Account \\nThe GRA reserves consist of the Special Reserve and the \\nGeneral Reserve. The General Reserve may be used inter \\nalia to meet capital losses and operational deficits or for \\ndistribution to IMF members. The Special Reserve can be \\nused for the same purposes except distribution to members. At April 30, 2022, the balanc es of Special and General \\nReserves amounted to SDR 13,692 million and SDR 12,832 million, respectively (SDR 11,347 million and SDR 12,003 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021).  \\n16.2  Income disposition \\nThe Executive Board determines annually what part of the GRA net income (as described below) will be placed to the General Reserve and/or the Special Reserve, and what part, \\nif any, will be distributed. Net losses are charged against the \\nSpecial Reserve in accordance with an Executive Board \\ndecision.  \\nThe GRA net income/losses for the purpose of the income \\ndisposition includes: (i) total income of the GRA; (ii) transfer \\nfrom the IA as approved by the Executive Board; and (iii) the \\nremeasurement of net assets/ liabilities under retirement \\nbenefit plans. For the financia l years ended April 30, 2022, \\nand 2021, the Executive Board decided to place income to/charge losses against reserves as follows: \\n Special Reserve  General Reserve \\n \\nIncome Remea-\\nsurement Total Income Remea-\\nsuremen tTotal \\n  (in millions of SDRs) \\nBalance at     \\nApril 30, 2021 10,842 505 11,347 10, 983 1,020 12,003 \\nIncome of the \\nGRA 830 — 830 829 — 829 \\nTransfer from the IA — — — — — — \\nRemeasurement of net assets/liabilities \\nunder retirement \\nbenefit plans — 1,515 1,515 — — — \\nBalance at   \\nApril 30, 2022 11,672 2,020 13,692 11,812 1,020 12,832 \\n I.

Charges and fees  \\nThe average credit outstanding subject to charges amounted \\nto SDR 90,522 million and SDR 86,700 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  \\nThe rate of charge levied on outstanding credit is equal to the \\nbasic rate of charge adjusted for burden-sharing (see \\nNote 13). The basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate \\nplus a fixed margin as determined by the Executive Board, which for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, \\namounted to 100 basis points. The average rate of charge \\n(adjusted for burden-sharing) was 1.107 percent per annum \\nand 1.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended \\nApril 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\nCredit outstanding in excess of 187.5 percent of quota \\nresulting from purchases in the credit tranches and under the \\nEFF and the SLL is subject to a level-based surcharge of \\n200 basis points per annum above the basic rate of charge. \\nAn additional time-based surcharge of 100 basis points per \\nannum applies to such credit outstanding for more than three years, except for purchases under the EFF, for which the \\nadditional surcharge of 100 basis points applies after 51 months. Purchases under the SLL are not subject to time-based surcharges given the short maturity of repurchase \\nobligations.  Charges income consisted of the following: \\n \\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2022, the IMF did not have \\noverdue charges to defer. The deferred charges during the \\nyear ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see \\nNote 13.1) and were fully recovered through the proceeds from burden-sharing adjustments to charges and \\nremuneration of SDR 1 million each (see also Note 18). \\n Other charges and fees cons isted of the following: \\n 2022  2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs) \\nService charges  71 115 \\nCommitment fee 283 70 \\nSpecial charges 88 — \\nTotal charges  442 185 \\n \\nA service charge of 50 basis points is levied by the GRA on \\nall purchases from the GRA, except for purchases under SLL arrangements, which are subject to a service charge of \\n21 basis points, and reserve tranche purchases, which are \\nnot subject to service charges.  \\nA commitment fee is levied on the amount available for \\nfinancing under an arrangement for each 12-month period \\nand refunded as the member makes purchases under the \\narrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, the commitment \\nfee amounts to 15 basis points per annum for access up to 115 percent of quota, 30 basis points for access between \\n115 and 575 percent of quota, and 60 basis points for access \\nin excess of 575 percent of quota. For SLL arrangements, \\nthe commitment fee amounts to 8 basis points and is not \\nrefundable when the member makes purchases under the \\narrangement. At the expiration or cancellation of a GRA arrangement any unrefunded amount is recognized as \\nincome, except for SLL arrangements for which commitment \\nfee income is recognized on a straight-line basis during the \\nduration of the arrangement. \\nThe GRA levies special charges on overdue repurchases \\nand charges of less than six mont hs’ duration. Currently, the \\nspecial rate of charge on overdue repurchases is set at zero and for overdue charges it is equal to the SDR interest rate. Such charges are deferred when not paid and recognized as  2022  2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs) \\nBasic charges before burden-sharing adjustment  1,043 930 \\nDeferred basic charges recovered through:   \\nBurden-sharing adjustment to charges — 1 \\nBurden-sharing adjustment to remuneration  — 1 \\nSurcharges  1,234 931 \\nTotal charges  2,277 1,863 \\nI.

Remuneration of members’ reserve tranche \\npositions  \\nRemuneration of members’ reserve tranche positions \\namounted to SDR 113 million and SDR 72 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\nA portion of the reserve tranche position is unremunerated. \\nFor a member that joined the IM F on or before April 1, 1978, \\nthe unremunerated portion is equ al to 25 percent of the \\nmember’s quota subscription on Ap ril 1, 1978 (that part of the \\nquota subscription that was paid in gold prior to the Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement). For a \\nmember that joined the IMF after that date, its \\nunremunerated reserve tranche is  a percentage of its initial \\nquota equivalent to the ratio of total unremunerated reserve \\ntranches for all other members to their total quota subscriptions when the new member joined the IMF. The \\naverage remunerated reserve tranche amounted to SDR \\n103,298 million and SDR 93,949 million during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  \\nThe rate of remuneration is currently equal to the SDR interest rate. Burden-sharing adjustments reduce the rate of remuneration, but under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the \\nrate of remuneration may be no lower than 80 percent of the \\nSDR interest rate. The average rate of remuneration (adjusted for burden-sharing) for the financial years ended \\nApril 30, 2022, and 2021, was 0.107 percent per annum and \\n0.077 percent per annum, respectively. The amounts of \\nburden-sharing adjustments for the same periods are \\ndisclosed in Note 17. \\n19.  Administrative expenses \\nAdministrative expenses, most of which were incurred in US dollars, were as follows: \\n Reimbursements represent repayment for the expenses incurred in conducting the bus iness of the SDR Department \\nand certain trusts and accounts administered by the IMF, and for the cost of the investment  operations of the SRP and the \\nRSBIA (see Notes 1.4 and 21). \\n20.  Special Disbursement Account  \\nAssets in the SDA can be used for special purposes authorized in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including providing financial assistance on special terms to low-income \\nmember countries under the St ructural Adjustment Facility \\nand the Trust Fund.  \\nThe SDA was initially activated to receive transfers from the \\nTrust Fund. The IMF is the Trus tee of the Trust Fund, which \\nwas established in 1976 to provide balance of payments \\nassistance on concessional terms to eligible members that \\nqualified for such assistance. The Trust Fund was in \\nliquidation following its termination in 1981. Since that date, the activities of the Trust Fund have been confined to the \\nconclusion of its affairs.  \\nAt April 30, 2021, the Trust F und had no assets other than \\nloans and interest receivable from Sudan amounting to \\nSDR 84 million. All interest income was deferred. There were no repayments to the Trust Fund during the financial year \\nended April 30, 2021. On June 29, 2021, Sudan repaid its \\ntotal amount outstanding to the Trust Fund loans, this amount was received in the SDA and contributed to the PRG \\nTrust, and the Trust Fund was liquidated. \\n21.  Related party transactions \\nThe expenses of conducting the business of the SDR \\nDepartment, the SRP, the SR BP, the RSBIA, and trusts \\nadministered by the IMF as Trus tee are paid by the GRA. At \\nthe end of each financial year, reimbursements are made by the SDR Department (through assessments levied on SDR \\nDepartment participants) and ce rtain trusts and accounts in \\naccordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and \\ndecisions of the Executive Board. The SRP and the RSBIA \\nreimburse the GRA for the cost of the investment operations.  \\nThe following summarizes the reimbursements to the GRA: \\n  2022 2021  \\n(in millions of SDRs) \\nPersonnel 636 587 \\nPension and other long-term employee benefits  213 504 \\nTravel 21 13 \\nOther 221 193 \\n 1,091 1,297 \\nReimbursements (123) (98) \\nTotal administrative expenses 968 1,199 \\n 2022  2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs)  \\nSDR Department  8 3 \\nSRP and RSBIA 4 3 \\nI. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n38 In April 2021, the Executive Board decided to forgo \\nreimbursement by the PRG Trust for the year ended April 30, \\n2021. Further in July 2021, the Executive Board decided to \\nforgo reimbursement by the PRG Trust through the financial year ending April 30, 2026. Expenses of the PRG Trust for \\nthe years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 were estimated at \\nSDR 76 million and SDR 87 million, respectively.  \\nThe General Department has transferred resources to the \\nPRG Trust, the Trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations for the Heav ily Indebted Poor Countries \\nand Interim ECF Subsidy Operations (the PRG-HIPC Trust), and the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCR Trust) to provide financial assistance to low-income \\ncountries.

Our \\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit \\nof the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to b e independent of the International \\nMonetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant \\nethical requirements relating to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United \\nStates of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for \\nProfessional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  \\n \\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial \\nStatements  \\n \\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in \\naccordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting \\nStandards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the \\npreparation and fair presentation of financial statements t hat are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error.  \\n \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to \\ncontinue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting \\nperiod , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of \\naccounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operations, or has \\nno realistic alter native but to do so.  \\n \\n   \\n \\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting \\nprocess.  \\n \\nAuditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  \\n   \\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that \\nincludes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolut e assurance and \\ntherefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always \\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting \\nfrom fraud is higher than for on e resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material \\nif there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggrega te, they would influence the judgment \\nmade by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  \\n \\nIn performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: \\n \\n● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  \\n● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \\nfraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such \\nprocedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regard ing the amounts and disclosures in \\nthe financial statements.  \\n● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit \\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an \\nopinion o n the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is \\nexpressed.   \\n● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant \\naccounting estimates made by management, as well as evalua te the overall presentation of the \\nfinancial statements.  \\n● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, \\nthat raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to continue as a going concern for a \\nreason able period of time.  \\n \\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the \\nplanned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control -related \\nmatters that we identified d uring the audit. \\n \\nSupplemental Information  \\n \\nOur audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a \\nwhole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 62 to 72 as of April 30, 2022 and \\nfor the yea rs ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are \\npresented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The \\nsupplemental schedules are the responsibility of mana gement and were derived from and relate directly to \\nthe underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information \\nhas been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and cer tain \\nadditional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying \\naccounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements  \\n \\nthemselves and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS.

Nature of operations \\n1.1  Role of the SDR \\nThe Special Drawing Right (SDR) is an international \\ninterest-bearing reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1969 to supplement existing reserve \\nassets. SDRs are created through allocations by the IMF to \\nparticipants in the SDR Department (see Note 1.7) and can be held and used by participants in the SDR Department, by \\nthe IMF through the General Re sources Account (GRA), and \\nby certain official entities designated by the IMF and referred to as “prescribed holders”. The IMF has the authority to \\ndesignate as “prescribed holders” of SDRs: (i) non-members; (ii) member countries t hat are not SDR Department \\nparticipants; (iii) institutions that perform the functions of a \\ncentral bank for more than one member; and (iv) other official entities. These prescribed holders may acquire and use \\nSDRs in transactions by agreement (see Note 1.5.1) and in \\noperations with participants and other holders. They may not, however, receive allocations of SDRs.  \\nThe value of the SDR as a reserve asset derives from the \\ncommitments of participants to hold and accept SDRs and to \\nhonor various obligations connected with the proper \\nfunctioning of the SDR Department. As such, the SDR is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF \\nmembers; however, it is not a claim on the IMF. A freely \\nusable currency is a member’s currency that the IMF has determined is widely used to make payments for international \\ntransactions and widely traded in the principal exchange \\nmarkets. At present, the Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, and US dollar are classified as freely \\nusable currencies. \\n1.2  Purpose of the SDR Department \\nThe SDR Department was est ablished within the IMF to \\nconduct all operations and transactions involving SDRs, \\nfollowing the creation of the S DR. IMF members may elect to \\nparticipate in the SDR Department. At April 30, 2022, and \\n2021, all members of the IMF were participants in the SDR \\nDepartment, and 15 institutions were approved as prescribed \\nholders. \\nThe IMF’s Articles of Agreement require that the resources of \\nthe SDR Department are held s eparately from the assets and \\nliabilities of all the other accounts of, or administered by, the \\nIMF. They may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, \\nor losses of the IMF incurred in the operations of the General \\nDepartment or other accounts, except that the SDR Department reimburses the General Department annually for \\nexpenses incurred in conducting the business of the SDR \\nDepartment. \\n1.3  SDR interest and charges \\nHolders of SDRs (i.e., the IMF, participants, and prescribed \\nholders) earn interest on their SDR holdings. Participants pay \\ncharges on their cumulative S DR allocations. Both interest \\nand charges are set at the SDR interest rate (see Note 2.2). \\nParticipants that use their SD Rs will pay more charges than \\nthey will receive interest on their holdings, to the extent that \\nthey hold fewer SDRs than their cumulative allocations. \\nConversely, participants that  hold more SDRs than their \\ncumulative allocations will receive more interest on their \\nholdings than the charges they will pay on their allocations. \\nCharges are also levied on any negative balance of a participant or unpaid charges. Total SDR interest on SDR \\nholdings is equal to total charges on SDR allocations in the \\nstatement of comprehensive income as total SDR holdings are equal to total SDR allocations. \\n1.4  Assessment \\nThe expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the IM F from the GRA, which is \\nreimbursed annually by the SDR Department. For this purpose, the SDR Department levies an assessment on all participants in proportion to their cumulative allocations at the \\nend of each financial year. \\n1.5  Uses of SDRs \\n1.5.1  Transactions by agreement and prescribed operations The IMF’s Articles of Agreement authorize the exchange of \\nSDRs for currency among participants, and the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) has the power to \\nauthorize other operations. \\nParticipants in the SDR Department may buy SDRs to \\ndischarge their obligations to the IMF or to replenish their \\nSDR holdings. They may also sell SDRs in order to adjust the composition of their re serves (see Schedule 1). A \\nparticipant may use SDRs freely to obtain an equivalent amount of currency in a transaction by agreement. Prescribed holders may enter into SDR sale or purchase \\ntransactions with participants or among themselves.  \\nParticipants may conduct such transactions bilaterally with \\nany participant or prescribed holder. However, in practice, II. SDR Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n56 such transactions are generally made through the voluntary \\ntrading market (see Note 1.6). \\nThe SDR is also used by several international and regional \\norganizations as a unit of account or as the basis for their units of account. Several international conventions and \\ntreaties also use the SDR as a unit of account. An institution \\nmay use the SDR as its unit of account without being a participant in the SDR Department. \\n1.5.2  GRA operations \\nParticipants can use SDRs in  operations and transactions \\ninvolving the GRA, such as acquisitions of SDRs from the GRA, the payment of a portion of the participant’s quota, \\npayment of charges, and repurchases. The GRA can use \\nSDRs in operations and transactions involving participants, \\nsuch as purchases, payment of  remuneration, payment of \\ninterest on GRA borrowings and repayment of GRA \\nborrowings (see Schedule 1).  \\n1.5.3  Other IMF-related operations \\nAs a trustee for trusts set up for concessional lending and \\ndebt relief (Trusts), the IMF c onducts certain transactions in \\nthe SDR Department through a prescribed holder of SDRs. \\nThese transactions mainly include PRG Trust pass-through \\nlending involving participants in the SDR Department. Other transactions in the Trusts include financial contributions \\nprovided by participants to the Trusts (see Schedule 1). \\n1.6  Voluntary trading market \\nThe voluntary trading market in SDRs is coordinated by the \\nIMF via voluntary trading arrangements (VTA) with a group of \\nparticipants and one prescribed holder to buy and sell SDRs. \\nThe role of the IMF in these transactions is to act as an intermediary, matching participants in this managed market \\nin a manner that meets, to the greatest extent possible, the \\nrequirements and preferences of buyers and sellers of SDRs.  \\nThe VTA allow the IMF to fac ilitate purchases and sales of \\nSDRs on behalf of any participant or prescribed holder in the SDR Department against freely usable currencies, subject to \\nthe constraint that all transacti ons take place at the official \\nSDR exchange rate for t he currency involved.  \\nTo date, the voluntary trading market has proved sufficiently \\nliquid to absorb demand for sales and acquisitions of SDRs. However, in the event that there are not enough voluntary buyers, the IMF’s Articles of Agreement provide for a \\ndesignation mechanism to guar antee the liquidity of the \\nSDR. The designation mechanism, which was last activated \\nin 1987, provides a backstop  to exchange SDRs for \\ncurrency, for members with balance of payments needs.   \\n \\n 1.7  Allocations and cancellations of SDRs \\n1.7.1  General allocations \\nThe IMF’s Board of Governors,  on the basis of proposals of \\nthe Managing Director and ag reement by the Executive \\nBoard, has the authority to provide unconditional liquidity through general allocations of SDRs to participants in the \\nSDR Department. In all of its decisions on general allocations \\nof SDRs, the IMF, as prescribed under its Articles of \\nAgreement, must seek to meet the long-term global need to supplement existing reserve assets in such manner as will \\npromote the attainment of the IMF’s purposes and avoid \\neconomic stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand \\nand inflation. A general SDR allocation also requires the \\nsupport of an 85 percent majority of the total voting power.  \\nSince the creation of the SDR in  1969, there have been four \\ngeneral allocations. The first allocation was distributed in \\n1970–72 (SDR 9.3 billion), the second in 1979–81 (SDR 12.1 \\nbillion), the third in 2009 (SDR 161.2 billion), and the fourth, \\nthe largest so far, was approved by the Board of Governors \\nof the IMF on August 2, 2021  (SDR 456.5 billion). The fourth \\ngeneral allocation was made on August 23, 2021, to IMF members that are participant s in the SDR Department, in \\nproportion to their paid IMF quotas as of the date of adoption \\nof the Board of Governors’ resolution.  \\nDecisions to allocate SDRs are typically made at the start of “basic periods,” which run consecutively and are normally for five years. Under the IMF’s Ar ticles of Agreement, the IMF \\nhas the flexibility to decide whether the basic period should be less than five years. The current basic period (the twelfth basic period) is January 1, 2022–December 31, 2026.  \\n1.7.2  Special allocation under the Fourth Amendment \\nThe Fourth Amendment to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement \\nbecame effective on August 10, 2009, and provided for a \\nspecial one-time allocation of SDR 21.5 billion.\\n The purpose \\nof the special allocation was to enable all members of the \\nSDR Department to participate in the SDR system and to \\ncorrect for the fact that count ries that joined the IMF after \\n1981 (more than one-fifth of the IMF membership, and \\nnotably many of the economies in transition), had not \\nreceived an SDR allocation at the time.  \\nSDRs allocated under a special allocation to participants with \\noverdue obligations to the IMF (i.e., the GRA, the \\nSDR Department, and overdue liabilities to the IMF as \\ntrustee), are held in an escrow account within the SDR \\nDepartment and are released to such participants upon settlement of all overdue obligations to the IMF (see Note 4).  II. SDR Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 57 1.7.3  Cancellation of SDRs \\nThe IMF has the authority to cancel, in part or in whole, \\nSDRs created under previous allocations. To date there have \\nbeen no cancellations. \\n2.  Basis of preparation and measurement \\nThe financial statements of  the SDR Department are \\nprepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial \\nstatements have been prepared under the historical cost \\nconvention. The financial statements have also been prepared on the basis that the SDR Department will continue \\nto operate as a going concern. \\nThe SDR Department is self -financed and does not have any \\nequity as net cumulative allocations are equal to SDR \\nholdings. It holds no cash or cash equivalents and, as net \\noperational income and net expenditure are always equal, it generates no income. Cash flows arising from operating \\nactivities are limited to the receipt of charges and \\nassessments and payment of interest and administrative \\nexpenses. A statement of cash flows is not presented as it \\nwould not provide additional information beyond that already \\ncontained in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. \\nChanges in SDR holdings are shown in Schedule 1. \\n2.1  Unit of account \\nThe financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the \\nIMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined \\ndaily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket \\ncurrencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market \\nexchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition \\nof the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These \\nreviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR \\nvaluation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of \\ncurrencies), determine the relative weights of those \\ncurrencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are \\nused to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the \\ncurrencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30, \\n2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  \\nSDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount \\nChinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174 \\nEuro 30.93 0.38671 \\nJapanese yen 8.33 11.900 \\nPound sterling 8.09   0.085946 \\nUS dollar  41.73 0.58252 \\n At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$ 1.34430 \\n(US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive \\nBoard decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  \\nOn May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the \\nquinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR \\nand agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR \\ncurrency and interest rate baskets and approved their \\nupdated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher \\nweights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, \\nthe euro, and the Japanese yen.  \\nEffective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket \\nwill be assigned the following weights:  \\nSDR basket currency Weight (in percent) \\nChinese renminbi 12.28 \\nEuro 29.31 \\nJapanese yen 7.59 \\nPound sterling 7.44 \\nUS dollar  43.38 \\n \\nThe amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated \\non July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the \\ninterim justify an earlier review.  \\n2.2  SDR interest rate \\nThe SDR interest rate is used to calculate the interest paid \\non holdings and charges received on allocations. \\nThe SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a \\nweighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments \\nin the money markets of the SDR basket currencies as follows: \\nSDR basket currency Yield or rate \\nChinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China \\nTreasury bonds as published by the China \\nCentral Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. \\nEuro Three-month spot rate for euro area central \\ngovernment bonds with a minimum rating of \\nAA published by the European Central Bank \\nJapanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills \\nPound sterling Three-month Treasury bills \\nUS dollar Three-month Treasury bills \\n The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent \\nand is rounded to three decimal places. The average interest \\nrate was 0.107 percent and 0.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. II. SDR Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n58 2.3  Use of estimates and judgement \\nThe preparation of financ ial statements requires \\nmanagement to make judgements, estimates, and \\nassumptions that affect the application of the accounting \\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these \\nestimates. \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an \\nongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are \\nrecognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future pe riods affected.  \\nThe most significant estimates and judgements used in applying accounting policies include assessing potential impairment of the participant s’ net obligations to the \\nSDR Department (see Note 3). \\n \\n3.  Summary of significant accounting policies \\n3.1  Financial instruments \\nClassification and measurement \\nFinancial instruments are recognized when the SDR \\nDepartment becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \\nthe instrument. At initial recogn ition, a financial instrument is \\nmeasured at its fair value, wh ich is best evidenced by the \\ntransaction amount. Subsequently, financial instruments are \\nmeasured at amortized cost.  \\nImpairment  \\nAn allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) must be \\nrecognized for either 12-mont h or lifetime expected credit \\nlosses, depending on whether there has been a significant \\nincrease in credit risk since inception. In making such a \\ndetermination, all relevant information, including forward-\\nlooking information that is avai lable without undue cost or \\neffort, should be considered.  \\n \\nAt each reporting date, the SDR Department assesses on a \\nforward-looking basis the ECL associated with its financial \\nassets at amortized cost. The measurement of ECL reflects: \\n(i) an unbiased and probabilit y-weighted amount that is \\ndetermined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; (ii) \\nthe time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and supportable \\ninformation that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and \\nforecasts of future economic conditions. \\nIf the SDR Department needed to  recognize ECL, they would \\nbe recorded as impairment allowances. 3.2  SDR allocations and holdings \\nAn SDR allocation by the IMF to a participant results in an \\nincrease, by the same amount, of the participant’s SDR \\nholdings and allocations. Conversely, a cancellation of a \\nparticipant’s SDRs results in a decrease, by the same amount, of the participant’s SDR holdings and allocations. \\nNeither allocation nor cancellation changes the member’s net \\nposition in the SDR Department.  \\nParticipants with holdings below their allocations have a net \\nobligation to the SDR Department, which is presented as an asset in the statements of fina ncial position. Participants with \\nholdings above their allocations have established a net claim on the SDR Department, which is presented in the statements of financial position as a liability. \\nImpairment of participants’ net obligations to the SDR \\nDepartment \\nThe likelihood of the SDR Depar tment incurring credit losses \\nis remote considering the IMF’s unique relationship with its member countries, and its multilayered risk management \\nframework. In addition, the IM F enjoys a de facto preferred \\ncreditor status, which has been recognized by the official \\ncommunity and generally accepted by private creditors. The \\ndebtor positions in the SDR Department do not have maturity \\ndates and could be held until the participant’s withdrawal \\nfrom the SDR Department or the liquidation of the \\nSDR Department. Overdue charges, if any, would accrue \\ninterest at the SDR interest rate in perpetuity preserving the time value of money. The SDR Department has not \\nrecognized any impairment losses since inception. \\n3.3  Interest and charges  \\nInterest is accrued on holdings of SDRs, and charges are levied on each participant’s cumulative SDR allocations at \\nthe SDR interest rate, with t he net result to be paid or \\nreceived by the SDR Department  each quarter. If sufficient \\nSDRs are not received from the participant because charges are overdue, additional SDRs are temporarily created to cover the obligation. This is a receivable that is reversed \\nwhen the participant settles the overdue charges. Interest \\nand charges are settled by crediting and debiting the individual holdings accounts prom ptly at the beginning of the \\nfollowing quarter. \\n3.4  Assessment \\nExpenses of conducting the bus iness of the SDR Department \\nare recognized in the statements of comprehensive income on an accrual basis. The corresponding SDR assessment on allocations is recognized as income. II.

The amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The \\namendments will be adopted by t he SDR Department for the \\nfinancial year ending April 30, 2024, and are not expected to \\nhave a material effect on the SDR Department’s financial \\nstatements. \\nAmendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in \\nAccounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February \\n2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The \\namendments are effective for annual periods starting on or \\nafter January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by the SDR Department for the financial year ending April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the \\nSDR Department’s financial statements.  \\n4.

On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all its over due obligations to the IMF, \\ntotaling SDR 964  million. As a result, SDR 16.1 million \\npreviously held in escrow for Sudan was released to its SDR holdings account and its allocations were adjusted \\naccordingly. The balance held in escrow amounted to zero and SDR 16.1 million at April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021, \\nrespectively.  \\n \\n5.

Our \\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described i n the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit \\nof the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Trusts and the \\nInternational Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with  the \\nrelevant ethical requirements relating to our audits,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the \\nUnited States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for \\nProfessional Accountants. We believe tha t the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.  \\n \\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial \\nStatements  \\n \\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and  fair presentation of the financial statements in \\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting \\nStandards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  \\npreparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error.  \\n \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Trusts’ ability to \\ncontinue as a going c oncern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting \\nperiod , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of \\naccounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Trust s or to cease operations, or has no \\nrealistic alternative but to do so.  \\n  \\n \\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Trusts’ financial reporting process.  \\n \\nAuditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  \\n   \\nOur obje ctives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that \\nincludes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high level  of assurance but is not absolute assurance and \\ntherefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always \\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting \\nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \\nomissions, misrepresentatio ns, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material \\nif there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment \\nmade by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  \\n \\nIn performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: \\n \\n● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  \\n● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \\nfraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such \\nprocedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \\nthe financial statements.  \\n● Obtain an understanding of internal control r elevant to the audit in order to design audit \\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an \\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts’ internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is \\nexpressed.   \\n● Evaluate  the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant \\naccounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the \\nfinancial statements.  \\n● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are condition s or events, considered in the aggregate, \\nthat raise substantial doubt about the Trusts’ ability to continue as a going concern for a \\nreasonable period of time.  \\n \\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matte rs, the \\nplanned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control -related \\nmatters that we identified during the audit. \\n \\n   \\n \\nSupplemental Information  \\n \\nOur audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the  financial statements of each Trust \\ntaken as a whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 100 to 108 as of and for \\nthe year ended April 30, 2022 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are presented for \\npurposes of  additional analysis and are not a required part of the respective Trust’s financial statements.  \\nThe supplemental schedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate \\ndirectly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the respective Trust’s financial \\nstatements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied  in the audits of the \\nrespective Trust’s financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and \\nreconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the \\nrespective Trust’s financial s tatements or to the respective Trust’s financial statements themselves and \\nother additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the information to the \\napplicable procedures required by ISAs.  In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are fairly stated, in all \\nmaterial respects, in relation to the respective Trust’s financial statements taken as a whole.  \\n \\n \\n \\nJune 24, 2022  \\n \\nIII.

The Trusts provide loans on concessional terms and/or debt relief \\nassistance to qualifying low-income member countries.  \\nThe assets and liabilities of each Trust are held separately \\nfrom those of all other administered or proprietary accounts \\nof the IMF, including those of other Trusts. Each Trust’s \\nassets cannot be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or \\nlosses incurred in the administration of other accounts. Administrative expenses incurred by each Trust are paid by the IMF and reimbursed by each Trust in accordance with the \\nIMF’s Articles of Agreement and relevant decisions of the \\nIMF Executive Board (Executive Board). Resources not immediately needed in operations are invested as allowed by \\nthe individual instruments est ablishing each of the Trusts \\n(Trust Instruments).  \\n1.1  PRG Trust \\nThe PRG Trust provides loans on concessional terms to low-income member countries assessed as eligible to qualify for \\nPRG Trust financing by the Executive Board.  \\nUpon the request of a qualifying member country, PRG Trust \\nresources may be made available either under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright disbursements (i.e., \\nloans disbursed without an arrangement). An arrangement is \\na decision of the IMF, as Trus tee, that gives a member the \\nassurance that the Trust stands ready to provide resources \\nduring a specified period and up to a specified amount, in \\naccordance with the terms of the arrangement.  Financing in the PRG Trust is available under the following \\nfacilities:  \\ni. The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for members \\nwith protracted balance of payments problems \\nunder three- to five-year arrangements \\nii. The Standby Credit Facility (SCF) for actual or \\npotential short-term balance of payments needs \\nunder one- to three-year arrangements \\niii. The Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for urgent balance \\nof payments needs, which provides financial support \\nin an outright loan disbursement. \\nUntil April 10, 2010, the PRG Trust also provided loans under the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) to facilitate member \\ncountries’ adjustment to sudd en and exogenous shocks. The \\nlast ESF loans were fully repaid during the financial year \\nended April 30, 2021.The operations of the PRG Trust are \\nconducted through the following accounts:  \\nLoan Accounts   \\nAll concessional lending to low-income member countries \\nunder the PRG Trust facilitie s is conducted in the Loan \\nAccounts, which serve as pass-through for receipt and \\nprovision of principal for concessional lending (i.e., the PRG \\nTrust may borrow from lenders and onlend to the low-income \\nmember countries). The four Loan Accounts comprise three \\nearmarked accounts that service ECF, SCF, and RCF loans specifically, and a general account  that services loans for all \\nPRG Trust facilities.  \\nThe Loan Accounts receive interest from loans (at \\nconcessional interest rates) and may pay interest on \\nborrowings (at interest rates higher than the concessional \\ninterest rates), with the difference being covered by transfers from the Subsidy Accounts. \\nSubsidy Accounts   \\nThe Subsidy Accounts include the General, ECF, SCF, RCF \\nSubsidy Accounts (the General and Earmarked Subsidy \\nAccounts) and the Subsidy Reserve Account, which was \\nestablished on July 14, 2021.  \\nThe General and Earmarked Subsidy Accounts hold \\nresources to finance the cost of providing subsidized loans to low-income member countries; that is, the available \\nresources in these accounts are drawn by the Trustee to pay \\nthe difference between the interest due on PRG Trust loans and the interest due on borrowings in the Loan Accounts. \\nThe Subsidy Reserve Account is designed to subsidize PRG III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n80 Trust lending after the resources in the General and \\nEarmarked Subsidy Accounts are exhausted and to provide \\nadditional security to the lenders of the Loan Accounts in the \\nevent of delayed payment or nonpayment by PRG Trust borrowers and the depletion of the Reserve Account (see \\nbelow).  \\nThe resources of the Subsid y Accounts consist of grant \\ncontributions, transfers by the IMF from the Special \\nDisbursement Account (SDA), and net earnings from investments. The General Subsidy Account and Subsidy \\nReserve Account may also receive transfers from the Deposit \\nand Investment Account (see below). The Subsidy Accounts can also borrow from donors and invest the proceeds to \\ngenerate income for subsidization.   \\nReserve Account  \\nThe Reserve Account holds resources to: \\ni. Provide security to the lenders of the Loan Accounts \\nin the event of delayed or nonpayment by PRG Trust borrowers. \\nii. Meet temporary mismat ches between repayments \\nfrom borrowers and payments to lenders. \\niii. Reimburse the IMF for administering PRG Trust operations. \\niv. Generate investment income that can be used to \\nfund the PRG Trust when resources in the Subsidy \\nAccounts have been depleted. \\nThe resources of the Reserve Account consist of transfers \\nfrom the SDA and net earnings from investments.  \\nDeposit and Investment Account  \\nThe Deposit and Investment Account was established on \\nJuly 14, 2021, to provide a separate vehicle for the PRG \\nTrust to borrow resources to generate net investment \\nearnings for the benefit of t he Subsidy Reserve Account or, \\nat the request of donors, the General Subsidy Account. The \\nresources held in the Deposit and Investment Account \\nconsist of the proceeds from  deposit and other investment \\nagreements with contributors and the net investment \\nearnings on the investment of these resources. \\n1.2  PRG-HIPC Trust and the PRG-HIPC Umbrella \\nAccount \\nThe PRG-HIPC Trust provides assistance to eligible low-\\nincome member countries to reduce their external debt \\nburden to sustainable levels. Assistance from the PRG-HIPC \\nTrust may be provided in the form of grants or loans. \\nThe operations of the PRG- HIPC Trust are conducted \\nthrough subaccounts within t he PRG-HIPC Trust Account \\nand the related Umbrella Account. The PRG-HIPC Trust \\nAccount receives and invests resources, which consist of grant contributions, transfers from the SDA, and net earnings \\nfrom investments. The PRG-HIPC Trust can also borrow \\nfrom donors and invest the proceeds to generate income for \\nits operations. Once the Execut ive Board approves a grant \\nfor debt service relief to an eligible low-income member \\ncountry, the respective resources are transferred to the PRG-\\nHIPC Umbrella Account, where they are administered on \\nbehalf of that member count ry until conditions for the \\ndisbursements of debt service re lief on behalf of the member \\ncountry are satisfied. \\n1.3  CCR Trust and the CCR Umbrella Account \\nThe CCR Trust provides balance of payments assistance in \\nthe form of grants to eligible low-income member countries following qualifying catastrophic natural or public health \\ndisasters.  \\nThe operations of the CCR Trust are conducted through \\nthree Trust Accounts and the related Umbrella Account. The \\nCCR Trust Accounts comprise two earmarked accounts for \\nCatastrophe Containment and Post-Catastrophe assistance \\nand the General Account, containing nonearmarked funds available for both types of assistance. These accounts receive and invest resources, which consist of grant \\ncontributions, transfers from the SDA, and net earnings from \\ninvestments. The CCR Trust can also borrow from donors and invest the proceeds to generate income for its \\noperations. Once the Executive Board approves a grant for \\ndebt service relief to an eligible low-income member country, \\nthe respective resources are transferred to the CCR \\nUmbrella Account, where they are administered on behalf of \\nthat member country until condit ions for the disbursements of \\ndebt service relief are satisfied. \\n1.4  Impact of geopolitical and global economic \\ndevelopments \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in \\nglobal economic activity. The IMF, as Trustee of the Trusts, \\nresponded to the crisis with unprecedented speed and magnitude of financial assistance to help low-income \\nmember countries. During the financial year ended April 30, \\n2021, the PRG Trust disbursed a significant number of loans to eligible member countries under the RCF (see Note 6.2). \\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Executive Board \\napproved a decision on March 26, 2020, to adapt the \\neligibility criteria for receiving assistance in the CCR Trust for \\na qualifying public health disaster. Subsequently, the Executive Board determined that  the COVID-19 pandemic is \\na qualifying public health disaster, effective April 14, 2020, and approved a significant amount  of grants for debt relief \\nassistance in the CCR Trust (see Note 9.1). III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 81 As a result of the Trusts pr oviding an elevated level of \\nfinancial assistance, the PRG Trust’s credit exposure has \\nincreased compared with the pre-pandemic level (see Note \\n4.2.1.2), as did the liquidi ty needs in the PRG and CCR \\nTrusts (see Note 4.2.3.1). \\nThe evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant \\nuncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth \\nand elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further \\ndemand for lending arrangements in the coming months. \\nThe war in Ukraine that start ed in February 2022 is expected \\nto have a significant negative effect on global growth through \\ncommodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war \\ncould trigger additional demand for financial assistance.  \\nThe PRG Trust continues to manage its credit risks in \\naccordance with its existing risk management framework \\n(see Note 4.1) and fundraising efforts are on-going to ensure \\nthe Trusts are adequately fina nced (see Note 4.2.3.1).  \\nThe risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have \\neffectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the \\nglobal developments on the in vestment portfolios of the \\nTrusts. Financial instruments held at fair value recognized through profit or loss had fully and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the onset of the pandemic. However, \\nin light of the war in Ukra ine, and tightening monetary \\nconditions, coupled with a sharp increase in inflation and \\ninflation expectations, the investment portfolios remain \\nsubject to challenging market conditions and high volatility. \\nThe effects of global developments on PRG and PRG-HIPC Trust investment portfolios are also reflected in the value at \\nrisk (VaR) (see Note 4.3.2.1). The valuation of the Trusts’ \\ninvestments held at amorti zed cost was not impacted. \\nAs of the date of these fina ncial statements there had been \\nno negative impact of global developments on the \\noperational results of the Trusts, including from any \\nimpairment analysis of the PRG Trust’s loan portfolio (see \\nNote 6.3). See also Note 2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of Trusts’ \\nfinancial statements. \\n2.  Basis of preparation and measurement \\nThe financial statements of the Trusts are prepared in \\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards \\nBoard (IASB). The financial st atements have been prepared \\nunder the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial instrument s at fair value through profit \\nor loss. The financial statements have also been prepared on the basis that the Trusts will continue to operate as going \\nconcerns. \\n2.1   Unit of account \\nThe financial statements are pr esented in SDRs, which the \\nTrusts use as the unit of a ccount. The value of the SDR is \\ndetermined daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of \\nthe basket currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of \\nmarket exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the \\ncomposition of the SDR valuation basket at five-year \\nintervals. These reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the \\nselection of currencies), deter mine the relative weights of \\nthose currencies, and assess t he financial instruments that \\nare used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts \\nof the currencies in the ba sket, at April 30, 2022, and \\nApril 30, 2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows: \\nSDR basket currency  Weight (in percent) Amount \\nChinese renminbi  10.92 1.0174 \\nEuro 30.93 0.38671 \\nJapanese yen 8.33 11.900 \\nPound sterling 8.09 0.085946 \\nUS dollar  41.73 0.58252 \\nAt April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430 (US$ \\n1.43599 at April 30, 2021). \\nThe current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled \\nto expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive \\nBoard decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  \\nOn May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the \\nquinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR \\nand agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR \\ncurrency and interest rate baskets and approved their \\nupdated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher \\nweights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, \\nthe euro, and the Japanese yen.  \\nEffective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket \\nwill be assigned the following weights:  \\nSDR basket currency Weight (in percent) \\nChinese renminbi 12.28 \\nEuro  29.31 \\nJapanese yen    7.59 \\nPound sterling    7.44 \\nUS dollar    43.38 \\nThe amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated \\non July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the \\nnew weights. The next review of the method of valuation of III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n82 the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the \\ninterim justify an earlier review.  \\n2.2  SDR interest rate \\nThe SDR interest rate is used to calculate interest on certain cash balances and borrowings. The SDR interest rate also provides the basis for setting the interest levied on PRG \\nTrust outstanding loans (see Note 6.4) and interest \\ncalculated on most borrowings in the PRG Trust’s Loan \\nAccounts.  \\nThe SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a \\nweighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments \\nin the money markets of the members whose currencies are included in the SDR valuation basket: \\nSDR basket currency Yield or rate \\nChinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China \\nTreasury bonds as published by the China \\nCentral Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. \\nEuro Three-month spot rate for euro area central \\ngovernment bonds with a minimum rating of \\nAA published by the European Central Bank \\nJapanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills \\nPound sterling Three-month Treasury bills \\nUS dollar Three-month Treasury bills \\n The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent \\nand is rounded to three decimal places.  \\nThe average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum \\nand 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years \\nended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\n2.3  Use of estimates and judgement \\nThe preparation of financ ial statements requires \\nmanagement to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies \\nand the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an \\nongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are \\nrecognized in the period in which the estimates are revised \\nand in any future periods affected.  \\nThe most significant estimates and judgements used in \\napplying accounting policies include expected credit losses \\nmeasurement for PRG Trust outstanding loans (see Notes \\n3.1, 3.2.3, and 6.3), the application of the practical expedient \\nunder the interest rate benchmark reform (see Note 4.2.2.1), \\nand fair value measurement of  financial instruments (see \\nNotes 3.3 and 10). 3.  Summary of significant accounting policies \\n3.1  Financial instruments  \\nFinancial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Note 3.2. \\nMeasurement at initial recognition \\nFinancial instruments are recognized when the Trusts \\nbecome a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Trusts use settlement date accounting for all \\nfinancial instruments except for investments, which are \\naccounted for using trade date accounting (see Note 3.2.2). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at its \\nfair value, which is best evidenced by the transaction \\namount.  \\nDerecognition  \\nFinancial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when \\nthe contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the \\nassets have expired, or when they have been transferred and \\neither: (i) the Trusts transfe r substantially all the risks and \\nrewards of ownership; or (ii) the Trusts neither transfer nor retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but \\nthe Trusts have not retained control.  \\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when they are \\nextinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged, \\ncanceled, or expires).  \\nClassification and subsequent measurement of financial \\nassets \\nA financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial \\nasset and its contractual cash flow characteristics. \\nFinancial assets that are held for collection of contractual \\ncash flows where those cash flows represent solely \\npayments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized \\ncost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is \\nincluded in the statements of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.  Any gain or loss arising on \\nderecognition is recogniz ed in the statements of \\ncomprehensive income.  \\nFinancial assets that are held for collection of contractual \\ncash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows \\nrepresent solely payments of principal and interest, would be \\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Trusts did not have financial assets at FVOCI \\nduring the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\nAll other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be \\nmeasured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with \\nchanges in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 83 Impairment  \\nAt each reporting date, the Trusts assess on a \\nforward-looking basis the ex pected credit losses (ECL) \\nassociated with their financial assets at AC and with the \\nundrawn balances under their lending commitments. The \\nmeasurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and \\nprobability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating \\na range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is \\navailable without undue cost or effort at the reporting date \\nabout past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future \\neconomic conditions.  \\nIf the Trusts needed to recognize ECL, they would be \\nrecorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as \\na liability provision for undrawn commitments.  \\nShould any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest \\nincome would be calculated for it by applying the effective \\ninterest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment \\nallowance). \\nClassification and subsequent measurement of financial \\nliabilities \\nDerivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with \\nchanges in fair value recognized in profit or loss. \\nAll other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. \\nInterest expense from these financial liabilities is included in \\nthe statements of comprehensiv e income using the effective \\ninterest method. \\n3.2  Financial assets and liabilities  \\n3.2.1  Cash and cash equivalents \\nCash and cash equivalents are financial assets measured at \\nAC. They comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and \\nother highly liquid short-term investments that are readily \\nconvertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an \\ninsignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are held for the pur pose of meeting short-term \\ncash commitments rather than  for investment or other \\npurposes.  \\n3.2.2  Investments \\nInvestments are financial assets that include short-term \\ninvestments, fixed-term and demand deposits, fixed-income securities, equity securities, a nd derivative assets. Derivative \\nliabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in the statements of financial positi on. Among the Trusts, only the \\nPRG Trust invests in equity securities and derivatives. \\nThe Trusts’ investment portfolios are managed under defined \\ninvestment strategies (see Note 5), and their performance is \\nevaluated on a fair value basis. The business model for the \\ninvested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities are classified at FVPL. A portion of the funds may be held in fixed-term and demand \\ndeposits, pending investment in  assets consistent with each \\nTrust’s investment strategy or  as an investment decision to \\nachieve specific objectives. These investments are measured \\nat AC.  \\nPurchases and sales of investments are recognized on the \\ntrade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable \\nor payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, pending settlement of a transaction. \\nInvestment income compri ses interest income on \\ninvestments at AC, interest and dividend income, and \\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL \\ninvestments, including currency valuation differences arising \\nfrom exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all trading-related investment fees. \\nInterest income from investments is recognized using the \\neffective interest method. Dividend income is recognized based on the ex-dividend date. \\n3.2.3  Loans receivable  \\nLoans receivable are financial assets that are measured at \\nAC. They represent financing provided to low-income \\nmember countries under the various PRG Trust financing facilities (see Note 1.1).  \\nInterest income on loans receivable is recognized using the \\neffective interest method.  \\nImpairment of PRG Trust loans \\nThe PRG Trust’s assessment of its loans receivable for \\nimpairment is grounded in the c ontext of the nature of the \\nPRG Trust’s lending and the unique institutional st atus of the \\nIMF, as Trustee:  \\n\\uf0b7 The IMF, as Trustee, has a unique relationship with its \\nmember countries, all of which are shareholders in the \\ninstitution. \\n\\uf0b7 PRG Trust lending under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic \\npolicies that the member commits to in order to overcome \\nbalance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the PRG Trust. \\n\\uf0b7 The IMF, as Trustee, employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1.1). \\n\\uf0b7 The IMF, as Trustee, also has  de facto preferred creditor \\nstatus, which has been recognized by the official creditor community and generally accepted by private creditors.  \\nTaken together, these factor s significantly reduce the \\nlikelihood of the PRG Trust incurring credit losses.  III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n84 The PRG Trust has not recognized any impairment losses \\nsince inception. Also, unlike lar ge financial institutions in the \\nprivate sector, the PRG Trust’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to low-income member countries, with each member’s  circumstances varying. \\nTherefore, a statistical approach to credit risk assessment, such as probability of default  (PD) and loss given default \\n(LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector, is neither feasible nor appropriate for the PRG Trust.  \\nSimilarly, the assessment of the PRG Trust’s credit risk \\ncannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its unique \\ncharacteristics, the PRG Trust’s credit risk exposure is not comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial \\nfinancial entities, and as a cooperative member organization, \\nthe IMF, as Trustee, does not pr oduce its own internal credit \\nrating grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the PRG Trust is \\nassessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative \\nconsiderations pertaining to each debtor member, such as \\nthe status of the economic programs underlying PRG Trust \\nlending, if any; the member ’s cooperation on policy \\nimplementation and timely settlement of PRG Trust financial \\nobligations; and forward-looking assessments of the \\nmember’s capacity to repay. \\nThe PRG Trust has developed a model for ECL estimation \\nbased on changes in credit qua lity since initial recognition, \\nwhere credit quality is classi fied as Stage 1, Stage 2, or \\nStage 3. Loans for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that are \\ncredit-impaired (Stage 3), have their ECL measured on a lifetime basis. Loans for wh ich there was no significant \\nincrease in credit risk since initial recognition (Stage 1) have their ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL that result \\nfrom default events possible within the next 12 months. \\nThe key judgements and assumptions adopted by the PRG \\nTrust in the measurement of ECL are discussed below: \\n(i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired  \\nThe PRG Trust considers a member country to be in default \\nwhen it is six months or more overdue in settling its financial \\nobligations to the PRG Trust. This rebuts the presumption \\nthat default occurs no later than 90 days past due, reflecting the nature of the PRG Trust’s financing and the unique \\ninstitutional status of the IM F, as Trustee, as well as \\nconsistency with the threshold for internal risk management \\npurposes. A loan is considered credit-impaired when the \\nobligation has defaulted. \\n(ii) Significant increase in credit risk  \\nThe PRG Trust assesses whether a significant increase in \\ncredit risk has occurred on a member-by-member basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date with the \\nrisk of default at the date of the most recent disbursement to the debtor member. The asse ssment is performed at each \\nreporting date and takes into account a range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including overdue obligations to the \\nPRG Trust, signals of noncooperation by the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the PRG \\nTrust. The criteria used to identify significant increases in \\ncredit risk are monitored and reviewed for appropriateness at \\nleast annually.  \\nThe assessment does not rely on any single factor and may, \\non the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the \\npresumption that credit risk has increased significantly when \\ncontractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due. \\nDuring the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, \\nthe PRG Trust did not have any member country more than \\n30 days past due. \\n(iii) Low credit risk  \\nThe PRG Trust assumes that the credit risk of a member \\ncountry has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is considered to have low credit \\nrisk at the reporting date,  as defined below.  \\nCredit risk related to the PRG Trust’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; \\n(ii) the member country has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and \\n(iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in \\nthe longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow \\nobligations.  \\n(iv) Measuring ECL \\nECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with \\ncontractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash \\nshortfalls at the effective intere st rate, which is the interest \\nrate for PRG Trust loans set by the IMF, as Trustee. ECL are \\nestimated by assessing a range of possible outcomes in light of expected future economic conditions, weighted according \\nto the assessed probability of each outcome. This entails \\nconsiderable judgement and uncert ainty about the estimates.  \\nFor the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are inte gral to the PRG Trust’s financial structure and \\noperations are also considered, such as additional interest on \\noverdue obligations. \\nWrite-off \\nIn the unlikely event that a member with outstanding loans to \\nthe PRG Trust (i) withdraws from the IMF; (ii) repudiates its outstanding obligations to the PRG Trust, and (iii) there are \\nno prospects of recovering amounts due to the PRG Trust in the foreseeable future, the PRG Trust would recognize the ultimate loss, and the withdrawn member’s outstanding loan \\nto the PRG Trust would be written off.  III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 85 3.2.4  Borrowings \\nBorrowings are financial liabilities measured at AC and \\nrepresent financing received from lenders (see Note 7). \\nInterest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the effective interest method.  \\nFor borrowings that transition from a London Interbank \\nOffered Rate (LIBOR)-based interest rate, the Trusts apply \\nthe IASB’s Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform Phase 2 \\namendments, which were adopted early as disclosed in the financial statements for the year  ended April 30, 2021. The \\namendments include a practical expedient that allows for changes to the basis for determining contractual cash flows to be treated as changes to a floating rate of interest, \\nprovided certain conditions are met. The conditions include \\nthe change being necessary as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and the transition taking place on an \\neconomically equivalent basis.  \\n3.3  Fair value measurement \\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset \\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value \\nmeasurement is based on th e presumption that the \\ntransaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, \\nin the absence of a principal market, in the most \\nadvantageous market. \\nA three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair \\nvalue under which financial instruments are categorized \\nbased on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  \\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity \\ncan access at the measurement date; \\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within \\nLevel 1 that are observable for the asset or \\nliability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or \\nindirectly (i.e., derived from prices); \\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not \\nbased on observable market data (unobservable inputs). \\nWhen the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset \\nor liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level \\nwithin which the fair value me asurement is categorized is \\nbased on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair \\nvalue measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a \\nLevel 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are \\nboth observable and unobservable.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are \\ndescribed in Note 10.\\n \\n3.4  Foreign currency translation \\nTransactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the \\ntransaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other \\ncurrencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the \\ndate of the financial statements. Exchange differences \\narising from the settlement of transactions at rates different from those at the originatin g date of the transaction are \\nincluded in the determination of total comprehensive income.  \\n3.5  Contributions \\nThe Trusts accept contributions on such terms and conditions as agreed between the Trusts and the contributor. \\nContributions are recognized as income after the \\nachievement of specified conditions and are subject to the bilateral agreements stipulating how the resources are to be \\nused. \\n3.6  Debt relief assistance \\nThe PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts provide debt relief assistance to eligible members, which is used by the \\nmembers to pay their eligible debt service payments to the IMF’s General Resources Account (GRA) or PRG Trust.

Financial risk management \\n4.1  Risk management framework \\nBy virtue of their role established through the Trust \\nInstruments, the Trusts face a range of financial and \\nnonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and \\nassessment across the Trusts’ activities. The IMF, as \\nTrustee, has adopted the thre e lines of defense model for \\nrisk management.  \\n\\uf0b7 Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by \\nestablishing and main taining a system of internal controls. \\n\\uf0b7 A risk management function is responsible for developing \\nand maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and \\nreporting on the Trusts’ overa ll risk profile, highlighting \\nareas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.  \\n\\uf0b7 An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of \\ngovernance and internal control processes.  \\n Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the \\ncycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis \\nrisk acceptance.  \\n4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than \\ninvestments \\nFinancial assets and liabilities other than investments are \\nexposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  \\n4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than \\ninvestments Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses should any of the Trusts’ borrowers fail to fulfill their financial obligations \\nto the Trusts. Currently, only the PRG Trust is exposed to \\ncredit risk that arises on loans receivable and undrawn committed amounts under approved financing commitments.  \\n4.2.1.1  Credit risk management practices Credit risk is inherent in the PRG Trust’s unique role in the \\ninternational monetary system because the PRG Trust has \\nlimited ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides financing when other sources of credit are not \\navailable to a country. In addition, the PRG Trust’s credit concentration is generally hi gh due to the nature of the financial assistance provided to low-income member countries. \\nMeasures to help mitigate the PRG Trust’s credit risk include \\nprogram design and conditionality, which serve to help member countries solve their balance of payments problems \\nwithin the period of a PRG Trust-supported program and to provide the needed assurances that the member will be able \\nto repay the PRG Trust. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, regular reviews by the IMF, post-financing assessments, preventive and remedial measures for dealing \\nwith overdue financial obligations, and financial safeguards \\nsuch as special interest on overdue obligations.  \\nThe PRG Trust has established limits on overall access to its \\nresources. The Executive Boar d approved increases to the \\noverall annual and cumulative access limits across all PRG \\nTrust facilities on July 14, 2021. The annual access \\nincreased from 100 percent of a low-income member \\ncountry’s IMF quota (quota) to 145 percent, and the cumulative access limit increased from 300 percent of a low-\\nincome member country’s quota (net of scheduled \\nrepayments) to 435 percent. Access in excess of these limits \\ncan be approved in certain circumstances. The temporary \\nincreases in the annual and cumulative access limits for PRG Trust financing, which were approved in response to the \\ncrisis resulting from the CO VID-19 pandemic, expired on \\nDecember 31, 2021. The annual access limit had been \\ntemporarily increased from 100 to 150 percent of quota for \\nthe period July 13, 2020, thro ugh April 6, 2021, and further \\nincreased to 245 percent of quota during the period March \\n22, 2021 through December 31, 2021. In addition, the \\ncumulative access limit had been increased from 300 percent \\nto 435 percent of quota (net of  scheduled repayments) for the \\nperiod April 7, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and allowed to continue thereafter until the Executive Board’s next full review of concessional lending policies. \\nThe temporary increase in the annual limit for RCF \\ndisbursements from 50 percent to 100 percent of quota for the Exogenous Shock window expired on December 31, \\n2021, having been effective since April 6, 2020, as did the \\nincrease in the annual limit from 80 percent to 130 percent of quota for the RCF Large Natural Disaster window. The \\ntemporary increase in the cumulative access limit from \\n100 percent to 150 percent of quota (net of scheduled repayments) for the RCF Exogenous Shock window remains \\nin effect until end-June 2023, as does the temporary increase \\nin the cumulative access limit from 133.33 percent to \\n183.33 percent of quota (net of scheduled repayments) for \\nthe RCF Large Natural Disaster window. The rule of limiting \\nthe number of RCF disbursements (no more than two \\ndisbursements in a 12-month period) was reinstated on \\nJanuary 1, 2022, following a susp ension from July,13, 2021, \\nto December 31, 2021.  III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 87 The IMF, as Trustee, can approve access in excess of these \\nlimits in cases where the member is experiencing an \\nexceptionally large balance of payments need and has a \\ncomparatively strong adjust ment program, among other \\nconditions. There were no arrangements with exceptional \\naccess approved during the financial years ended April 30, \\n2022 and April 30, 2021.  \\nDisbursements under PRG Trust arrangements are made in tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, structural benchmarks, and prior \\nactions, as well as regular reviews by the IMF as Trustee.  \\nIn addition, the IMF, as Trustee, has adopted a safeguards \\npolicy to mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a \\nmisreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or \\nperformance against any conditions under a program supported by a PRG Trust arrangement. Safeguards \\nassessments of borrowing member countries’ central banks \\nare undertaken to provide the Trustee with reasonable assurance that the centra l banks’ legal structure, \\ngovernance, control, reportin g, and auditing systems are \\nadequate to maintain the integr ity of its operations and to \\nmeasure resources, including PRG Trust disbursements. When PRG Trust resources are provided as direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also \\nrequires that disbursements be deposited at the central bank, \\nand that an appropriate framework agreement between the \\ncentral bank and the government be in place to ensure timely \\nservicing of the member country’s financial obligations to the \\nPRG Trust. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of a state treasury is required for cases where a member country \\nrequests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of \\nfinancing provided by the PRG Trust is expected to be used \\nfor direct budget financing.  \\n4.2.1.2  Credit risk exposure \\nThe maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of \\nthe PRG Trust’s loans receivable and undrawn lending \\ncommitments, which was SDR 18,658 million and SDR 14,748 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\nLoans receivable amounted to SDR 14,788 million and \\nSDR 12,622 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The concentration of PRG Trust outstanding loans by region \\nwas as follows: \\n April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage \\nof total outstanding loans) \\nAfrica 10,673 72.2% 9,524 75.4% \\nAsia and Pacific 1,189 8.0% 1,245 9.9% \\nEurope 121 0.8% 110 0.9% \\nMiddle East and Central Asia 2,412 16.3% 1,380 10.9% \\nWestern Hemisphere 393 2.7% 363 2.9% \\nTotal 14,788 100.0% 12,622 100.0% \\nThe use of credit in the PRG Trust by the largest users was \\nas follows: \\n April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage \\nof total outstanding loans) \\nLargest user of credit 1,331 9.0% 1,431 11.3% \\nThree largest users of credit 3,160 21.4% 2,981 23.6% \\nFive largest users of credit 4,738 32.0% 4,274 33.9% \\n The five largest users of credit at April 30, 2022, in \\ndescending order, were Ghana, Sudan, Democratic Republic \\nof Congo, Kenya, and Cameroon (Ghana, C ȏte d’Ivoire, \\nKenya, Cameroon, and Madagascar at April 30, 2021). \\nOutstanding loans by member are presented in Schedule 1.  \\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number \\nof member countries have benefited from emergency \\nfinancial assistance under the RCF (See Note 6.1), including SDR 1,477 million to eight me mber countries that did not \\nhave an outstanding loan balance to the PRG Trust at March 31, 2020. There is no ex post  program-based conditionality \\nor reviews in the RCF, with ov erall conditionality limited. \\nAt April 30, 2022, undrawn commitments under 19 ECF arrangements and one SCF arrangement amounted to SDR 3,870 million (SDR 2,126 million under 11 ECF \\narrangements and one SCF arrangement at April 30, 2021). \\nCommitments and undrawn balances under current \\narrangements are presented in Schedule 2. There was no \\nfinancial assistance under the RCF that had been approved by the Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, \\n2022, and April 30, 2021. \\n4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than \\ninvestments \\nMarket risk is the risk that the fa ir value of futu re cash flows \\nof financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in \\nmarket prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and \\nexchange rate risk.  \\n4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk \\nInterest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will \\nfluctuate because of changes in  market interest rates. The \\nPRG Trust’s subsidy resources consist of contributions and \\ninvestment earnings to cover the interest shortfall arising \\nfrom the difference between the market-based interest rate \\npaid on the borrowings in the Loan Accounts and the \\nconcessional interest rate, if any, applicable to loans receivable. Should such resources be deemed inadequate \\nfor this purpose, the PRG Trust instrument allows for an \\nincrease in the interest rate levied on outstanding loans and a transfer of investment income from the Reserve Account to \\nthe General Subsidy Account, subject to consultations with III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n88 all creditors to the Loan Accounts on the adequacy of the \\nReserve Account to protect their claims. \\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform \\nThe PRG Trust is impacted by the retirement of LIBOR as \\ncertain borrowing agreements in the Loan Accounts include \\nan interest rate that uses LIBOR as a component of its \\ncomputation (LIBOR-based interest rate). The PRG Trust also holds certain derivatives that are priced using LIBOR. \\nThese derivatives are held for the purposes of managing \\nmarket risks (see Note 4.3.2).  \\nIn connection with its resource mobilization efforts for lending \\n(see Note 4.2.3.1), the IMF, as Trustee of the PRG Trust, \\nagreed to amend borrowing agreements with various lenders \\nby replacing LIBOR-based interest rate in these agreements \\nwith the SDR interest rate during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  \\nAt April 30, 2022, there were no PRG Trust Loan Account \\nborrowings accruing interest at  LIBOR-based interest rates \\n(SDR 1,216 million at April 30, 2021).  \\nAt April 30, 2022, the PRG Trus t’s currency swaps that were \\npriced using three-month Brit ish pound and US dollar LIBOR \\nhad a fair value of SDR 2 million and a notional value of \\nSDR 46 million (fair value of SDR 1 million and notional value of SDR 114 million at April 30, 2021). These currency swaps \\nwill mature before the retirement dates of three-month British \\npound and US dollar LIBOR, which are currently set for end-\\nJune 2023. \\n4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk \\nExchange rate risk is the risk that the Trusts’ financial position and cash flows will be affected by fluctuations in \\nforeign currency exchange rates. The exchange rate risk of \\nthe Trusts is mitigated by denom inating all assets, liabilities, \\nreceipts, and payments in SDRs. \\n4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other \\nthan investments \\nLiquidity risk is the risk of nonav ailability of resources to meet \\nthe financing needs of low-inco me member countries and the \\nTrusts’ own obligations.  \\n4.2.3.1  Liquidity management \\nThe IMF, as Trustee, conducts regular reviews to determine the adequacy of resources in the Trusts to provide financial \\nassistance to eligible IMF members and to meet the Trusts’ \\nobligations.  \\nThe PRG Trust must have financing available to meet low-\\nincome member countries’ demand for credit. Uncertainties \\nin the timing and amount of credit extended expose the PRG \\nTrust to liquidity risk. Moreov er, the PRG Trust must also \\nstand ready to provide funds for unexpected needs, for example, to authorize drawings to meet demands for \\nencashment of creditor claims under the Loan Accounts’ \\nborrowings (see Note 4.2.3.2).  \\nThese financing needs are met by the PRG Trust Loan \\nAccounts’ borrowings (see Note 7). Amounts available under \\nborrowing and note purchase agreements in the PRG Trust \\nLoan Accounts were SDR 23,091 million and \\nSDR 21,380 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively \\n(see also Schedule 3). Should such resources be deemed inadequate for this purpose, the PRG Trust has measures to \\ncover the shortfall, as m entioned in Note 4.2.2.1. \\nThe PRG Trust has a cumulative borrowing limit, established \\nby the Executive Board, to ensure that the IMF, as Trustee of \\nthe PRG Trust, does not enter into borrowing agreements \\nabove the limit for the PRG Tr ust Loan Accounts without prior \\nconsultation with PRG Trust creditors regarding the \\njustification for such borrowi ng and the adequacy of the PRG \\nTrust Reserve Account. In response to increased financing \\nneeds for lending in the PRG Trust brought about by the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the PRG Trust’s cumulative borrowing \\nlimit has increased to SDR 68, 000 million, as of July 14, \\n2021, from SDR 38,000 million in April 2020.  \\nThe PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts maintain cash balances to \\nmeet upcoming obligations, a nd the level of resources \\navailable for grant assistance is periodically monitored against the potential needs of eligible member countries. \\nFundraising efforts for both trusts are currently underway to \\nensure they remain adequately resourced.  \\n4.2.3.2  Maturity profile of loans and borrowings \\nThe repayment terms of PRG Trust loans are 5½ to 10 years \\nfor the ECF, ESF, and RCF and 4 to 8 years for the SCF, in \\nequal semiannual installments. Scheduled repayments of \\nPRG Trust outstanding loans are summarized below: \\nFinancial year  2022 2021 \\n(in millions of SDRs) \\n2022  — 657 \\n2023 730 731 \\n2024 761 761 \\n2025 828 828 \\n2026  1,749 1,728 \\n2027  2,299 2,094 \\n2028 and beyond 8,421 5,823 \\nTotal 14,788 12,622 \\n \\nRepayments during the financial year ended April 30, 2022, included advance repayments of SDR 170 million of which \\nSDR 169 million related to proceeds from CCR Trust debt \\nrelief assistance that was applied to PRG Trust outstanding loans (SDR 351 million during the financial year ended April \\n30, 2021). III.

Counterparty risk for \\nderivative instruments is mitiga ted by strict exposure limits, \\ncredit rating requirements, and collateral requirements.  \\nPRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts’ Investments  \\nCredit risk is minimized by limiting eligible investments to \\nmarketable securities rated at least A (based on Standard & Poor’s rating scale). Eligible investments include high-quality \\nshort-duration fixed-income securities, which include \\nmarketable obligations issued by: (i) national governments of members, their central banks,  or their national official \\ninstitutions; and (ii) internatio nal financial organizations, and \\ndeposits with a commercial bank, national official financial \\ninstitution of a member, or  an international financial \\ninstitution, incl uding the BIS.  III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n90 4.3.1.2  Credit risk exposure \\nThe carrying value of the fixed-income instruments and short-\\nterm investments represents the maximum exposure to credit \\nrisk. The maximum exposure to credit risk for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized gains on such \\ncontracts.  \\nThe credit risk exposure for fixed-income instruments and \\nshort-term investments in the PRG Trust at the end of the \\nrespective reporting periods was as follows: \\n April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 \\n (as a percentage of total fixed-income \\ninstruments and short-term investments) \\nBIS obligations (not rated) 26.7 26.7 \\nAAA 10.8 7.4 \\nAA+ to AA– 19.3 22.0 \\nA+ to A– 26.7 28.4 \\nBBB+ to BBB– 16.5 15.5 \\nTotal 100.0 100.0 \\n \\nThe credit risk exposure for the PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts’ \\ninvestments was limited to BIS obligations that are not rated \\nand amounted to SDR 301 million and SDR 61 million at April 30, 2022, respectively (SDR 301 million and \\nSDR 18 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021). \\nThe credit risk exposure for derivative assets in the PRG \\nTrust amounted to SDR 10 million and SDR 12 million, \\nrespectively, at April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\n4.3.2  Market risk on investments \\nMarket risk is the risk that the fa ir value of futu re cash flows \\nof financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in \\nmarket price. The investment objectives and strategies of the \\nTrusts, including asset allocation and risk tolerance (see \\nNote 5), expose the Trusts’ investments to market risk. These risks include interest rate  risk, exchange rate risk, and \\nother price risks.  \\nPRG Trust investments  \\nThe market risks on the PRG Tr ust investment portfolio are \\nmitigated by: (i) ensuring divers ification at the portfolio level \\nthrough a target asset allocation and within asset class components through concentration and exposure limits; \\n(ii) setting duration limits for fixed-income components; (iii) aligning or hedging the currency exposure of short-term \\ninvestments, short-duration fixed-income securities, and \\ncorporate bonds with the SDR currency basket; and (iv) permitting the use of derivatives for managing interest \\nrate and exchange rate risks.  \\nPRG-HIPC and CCR Trust investments \\nThe market risks on the PRG-HIPC and CCR Trust \\ninvestment portfolios are mitigated by: (i) setting duration limits for fixed-income components and (ii) rebalancing the portfolios periodically. Fixed-term and demand deposits held \\nin the Trusts’ investment portfo lios are denominated in SDRs \\nand carry a fixed rate of intere st or the SDR interest rate. \\n4.3.2.1  Value at Risk Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange \\nrate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which \\nconsiders known market risks in each of the asset categories \\nand the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates reported below represent the maximum potential loss in \\nvalue of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market \\nmovements, with a 95 percent conf idence level. There is a 1 \\nin 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year \\ncould exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount. \\nThe VaR model is based on historical simulations with a \\nthree-year lookback period, and monthly overlapping risk \\nfactor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios to produce plausible future scenarios based on these \\nsimulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on \\nthe valuation date is shocked according to past observations \\nand each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical \\ndistribution of returns. There is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk \\ncharacteristics of the in vestments involves many \\nassumptions and approximations. Different assumptions or \\napproximations would produce significantly different VaR \\nestimates. \\nThe VaR was as follows: \\n PRG Trust  PRG-HIPC Trust \\n April 30  April 30  \\n 2022 2021  2022 2021 \\n (in millions of SDRs) \\nEquity securities 396 473  — — \\nFixed-income securities 225 146   3 2 \\nDiversification effects (128) (136)   — — \\nTotal  493 483  3 2 \\n4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments \\nLiquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an \\ninvestment will not have an active buyer or seller when traded, which could negatively affect the price of the \\ninvestment.  \\n4.3.3.1  Liquidity management The liquidity position of each Trust is closely monitored by \\nmaintaining liquidity projections to ensure day-to-day \\nservicing needs are met. To minimize the risk of loss from liquidating investments, the Trusts hold resources in readily \\nmarketable short-term financial instruments to meet \\nanticipated liquidity needs. III.

Both \\ntranches can be invested in a range of fixed-income \\nsecurities. \\nInvestments comprised the following: \\n April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021  \\n (in millions of SDRs)  \\nAt FVPL:    \\nShort-term investments 53  89 \\nEquity securities 1,647  1,668 \\nFixed-income securities 5,838  5,994 \\nDerivative assets 10  12 \\nTotal at FVPL  7,548  7,763 \\nAt AC:    \\nFixed-term and demand deposits 495  392 \\nTotal 8,043  8,155 \\n \\nFair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the PRG \\nTrust were SDR 10 million and SDR 27 million, respectively, \\nat April 30, 2022 (SDR 12 million and SDR 8 million, \\nrespectively, at April 30, 2021) .

Loans receivable  \\nAt April 30, 2022, and 2021, l oans receivable amounted to \\nSDR 14,788 million and SDR 12,62 2 million, respectively. \\n6.1  Changes in loans receivable \\nChanges in PRG Trust loans receivable were as follows: \\n Loan facilities \\nECF RCF SCF Total \\n(in millions of SDRs ) \\nApril 30, 2021 5,817 6,534 271 12,622 \\nDisbursements  2,249 460 115 2,824 \\nRepayments (592) (41) (25) (658) \\nApril 30, 2022 7,474 6,953 361 14,788 \\n \\n \\n Loan facilities \\nECF ESF RCF SCF Total \\n(in millions of SDRs) \\nApril 30, 2020 5,897 9 3,094 244 9,244 \\nDisbursements  630 — 3,520 89 4,239 \\nRepayments (710) (9) (80) (62) (861) \\nApril 30, 2021 5,817 — 6,534 271 12,622 \\n6.2  Emergency financial assistance \\nThe changes in loans receivable reflect emergency financing under the RCF that was provided by the PRG Trust to \\nlow-income member countries that faced urgent balance of \\npayments needs as a result of the economic impact of the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Outstanding loans by members are \\npresented in Schedule 1.\\n \\n6.3  Impairment analysis \\nThe PRG Trust has performed an impairment analysis of its portfolio of loans receivable in accordance with its ECL \\nmodel (see Note 3.2.3). Based on this analysis, no loss \\nallowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022, and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.3, the impairment \\nanalysis of the PRG Trust’s outstanding loans takes into \\naccount the unique nature of the PRG Trust’s financing and institutional status of the IMF,  as Trustee. The analysis was \\nperformed holistically for each debtor member based on qualitative and quantit ative considerations, taking into \\naccount relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.4. In this context, the results of the PRG Trust’s \\nimpairment analysis at April 30, 2022, and 2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in input parameters of the ECL calculation. \\n6.4  Interest on loans receivable \\nThe interest rate applicable to outstanding PRG Trust loans was zero for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and \\n2021. \\n \\nThe interest rates on PRG Trust lending are reviewed every \\ntwo years by the Executive Board. The interest rates are set for the upcoming two years and are based on the average \\nSDR interest rate for the latest 12-month period. The last \\nreview of the PRG Trust’s lending interest rates was \\ncompleted on July 14, 2021, and the interest rate was kept at \\nzero percent for all PRG Trust outstanding loans until end-July 2023 based on the interest rate structure in the table below:   \\nAverage SDR interest rate for the latest 12-month period ECF and SCF  \\n(in percent ) \\nLess than 2% — \\nBetween 2% and 5% 0.25 \\nGreater than 5% 0.50 \\n The interest rate on RCF loans is permanently set at zero. An interest waiver on ESF loans receivable was extended until \\nthey were fully repaid during the financial year ended \\nApril 30, 2021.  III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 93 7.  Borrowings \\nThe Trusts borrow on such terms and conditions as agreed \\nbetween the Trustee and individual lenders.  \\nBorrowings in the PRG Trust Loan Accounts provide \\nresources for on-lending to low-income member countries. \\nCommitments made by lenders to the PRG Trust Loan \\nAccounts are nonrevolving and subject to a time limit. \\nCreditors to the PRG Trus t may earmark their loan \\ncommitments for a specific Loan Account (ECF, SCF, or \\nRCF) or make them generally available for any loan facility. \\nProceeds from borrowings in the PRG Trust’s Subsidy Accounts and Deposit and Investment Account, the PRG-\\nHIPC Trust, and CCR Trust are invested and generate net \\ninvestment income. This income  contributes to the resources \\nfor operational use in the respective Trusts. \\n7.1  Changes in outstanding borrowings \\nChanges in the outstanding borrowings in the PRG Trust Loan and Subsidy Accounts were as follows: \\n PRG Trust Accounts   \\nLoan  Subsid y  Total \\n(in millions of SDRs)  \\nApril 30, 2021 12,789  277  13,066 \\nBorrowings  2,824  2  2,826 \\nRepayments (819)  —  (819) \\nApril 30, 2022 14,794  279  15,073 \\n PRG Trust Accounts    \\nLoan  Subsid y  Total \\n(in millions of SDRs)  \\nApril 30, 2020 9,413  277  9,690 \\nBorrowings  4,239  —  4,239 \\nRepayments (863)  —  (863) \\nApril 30, 2021 12,789  277  13,066 \\n7.2  Interest on outstanding borrowings \\nThe weighted average interest rate on PRG Trust variable interest rate borrowings was 0.10 percent per annum and \\n0.09 percent per annum for the financial years ended \\nApril 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. All PRG-HIPC and \\nCCR Trust borrowings are interest free. \\n8.  Contributions \\nThe Trusts’ operations are financ ed primarily by contributions \\nprovided by a broad segment of IMF member countries and \\nother donors, as well as cont ributions from the Special \\nDisbursement Account and Admi nistered Accounts, on behalf \\nof IMF member countries. These contributions are mobilized and managed under the PRG Trust for concessional lending \\nand under the PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts for debt relief.  Contributions comprised the following: \\n PRG \\nTrust  PRG-HIPC \\nTrust  CCR \\nTrust \\nFinancial year ended April 30, 2022 \\n(in millions of SDRs ) \\nBilateral and other donors  140  59  121 \\nSpecial Disbursement Account 84  —  — \\nSudan Administered Account  —  1  — \\nTotal 224  60  121 \\n \\n PRG \\nTrust  PRG-HIPC \\nTrust  CCR \\nTrust \\nFinancial year ended April 30, 2021 \\n(in millions of SDRs ) \\nBilateral and other donors  7  2  339 \\nSomalia Administered Account  —  1  — \\nTotal 7  3  339 \\n \\nCumulative contributions by member country in the PRG Trust Subsidy Accounts and the PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts \\nare presented in Schedule 4. \\n9.  Debt relief assistance \\n9.1  Response to the COVID-19 pandemic \\nOn April 13, 2020, the Executiv e Board approved an initiative \\nfor the IMF, as Trustee of the CCR Trust to provide financial \\nassistance, in the form of grants, to 29 member countries \\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pand emic. On October 6, 2021, \\ntwo additional member countries became CCR Trust-eligible. \\nThe initiative was completed during the financial year ended \\nApril 30, 2022, and assisted member countries to make debt \\nservice payments on their eligible debt falling due from April 14, 2020, to April 13, 2022. Fo llowing the Executive Board’s \\napproval, the grants were tran sferred from the CCR Trust \\nAccounts to the CCR Trust Umbrella Account, where debt \\nrelief assistance was disbursed and recognized as an \\nexpense. \\nDuring the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the Executive \\nBoard approved for the IMF, as  Trustee of the CCR Trust, to \\nprovide financial assistance by disbursing two tranches of \\ngrants, resulting in the recognition of debt relief assistance \\namounting to SDR 171 million (disbursement of two tranches \\nfor SDR 354 million during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). The debt relief assistance was applied toward eligible \\ndebt service payments for member countries with eligible \\ndebt in the GRA and the PRG Trust. Cumulative debt relief \\nassistance disbursed by the CCR Trust at April 30, 2022, by \\nmember country and by tranche, is presented in Schedule 5. III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n94 9.2  HIPC Initiative  \\nIn 1996, the IMF and the World Bank jointly launched the \\nHIPC Initiative to help relieve the external debt burden for \\nseveral eligible member countries. The HIPC Initiative \\ninvolves coordinated action by the international financial community, including multilateral institutions, to reduce the \\nexternal debt burden of these member countries to \\nsustainable levels. At April 30, 2022, 36 of 39 member \\ncountries eligible or potentially eligible for HIPC Initiative \\nassistance have received grants for debt relief, in full, from the IMF, as Trustee of the PRG-HIPC Trust. Of the three \\nremaining cases, Somalia and Sudan have made progress under the initiative (see below). The remaining member country, Eritrea, has no debt that is eligible for HIPC Initiative \\nassistance at April 30, 2022. \\nSomalia and Sudan  \\nThe Executive Board determined that Somalia and Sudan \\nwere eligible and qualified for debt relief assistance under the HIPC Initiative on March 25, 2020, and June 29, 2021, \\nrespectively. Both member countries’ future debt reduction \\nunder the HIPC Initiative is contingent on meeting specific \\ncriteria.  \\nThe Executive Board approved a grant for interim debt relief \\nassistance to Sudan amounting to SDR 1 million during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (SDR 1 million to Somalia \\nduring the financial year ended April 30, 2021). These grants \\nfor Somalia and Sudan were recognized as contributions in \\nthe PRG-HIPC Trust and were financed by transfers from the \\nSomalia Administered Account and Sudan Administered Account, respectively (see Note 8). During the financial years \\nended April 30, 2022, and 2021, debt relief assistance \\namounting to SDR 1 million and SDR 1 million was recognized as an expense when Somalia’s and Sudan’s debt \\nservice payments eligible under the HIPC Initiative fell due.  \\n10.  Fair value measurement  \\nValuation techniques used to value financial instruments \\ninclude the following: \\nLevel 1 \\nThe fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on \\nquoted market prices in an active market for identical assets \\nwithout any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and \\nderivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income \\nsecurities). These investments are included within Level 1 of \\nthe fair value hierarchy. \\nLevel 2  \\nThe fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not \\nactively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of \\nsignificant observable market information, such  as recently executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into \\naccount the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable, these securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value \\nhierarchy. \\nThe fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments \\n(foreign exchange forwards and currency swaps) not actively \\ntraded is determined using a pricing model that incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate \\ncurves. Given that the signific ant inputs into the pricing \\nmodels are market-observabl e, these instruments are \\nincluded within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy . \\n10.1  Investments  \\nThe following tables present the fair value hierarchy used to \\ndetermine the fair value of investments in the PRG and PRG-HIPC Trusts: \\nRecurring fair value measurements Level 1 Level 2 Total \\nApril 30, 2022 \\n(in millions of SDRs ) \\nPRG Trust  1,673 5,875 7,548 \\nPRG-HIPC Trust  2 254 256 \\n April 30, 2021  \\nPRG Trust  1,698  6,065  7,763  \\nPRG-HIPC Trust  1 259 260 \\n \\nThere were no Level 3 invest ments at April 30, 2022, and \\n2021. \\nDuring the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments \\ntotaling SDR 9 million were transferred from Level 1 into \\nLevel 2 (there were no transfers between levels during the \\nfinancial year ended April 30, 2021). These investments \\nrelate to equity secu rities where trading was either inactive or \\nquoted prices in the applicabl e market were not observable \\nas at April 30, 2022. Quoted pr ices for similar securities \\ndirectly observable in an alternative market were used for fair value measurement of these securi ties as at April 30, 2022.  \\nThere were no transfers between Levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\nInvestments in fixed-term and demand deposits are generally \\nof a short-term nature and are carried at amortized cost, \\nwhich approximates fair value. \\nBased on the fair value hierarchy, SDR 1 million in derivative \\nliabilities was categorized as Level 1 and SDR 26 million as \\nLevel 2 at April 30, 2022 (SDR 1 million and SDR 7 million, \\nrespectively, at April 30, 2021). There were no Level 3 derivative liabilities and no transfers of derivative liabilities III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 95 between Level 1 and Level 2 during the financial years ended \\nApril 30, 2022, and 2021.  \\n10.2  Loans receivable  \\nThe PRG Trust, and the IMF as Trustee, plays a unique role in providing balance of payments support to member countries. PRG Trust financing features policy conditions that \\nrequire member countries to implement macroeconomic and \\nstructural policies, and are an integral part of PRG Trust \\nlending. These measures aim to help member countries solve their balance of payments problems while safeguarding Trust resources. The fair value of PRG Trust loans receivable \\nas defined under IFRS 13 cannot be determined due to their \\nunique characteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, the Trustee, and the absence of a \\nprincipal or most advantageous market for PRG Trust loans.  \\n10.3  Other financial assets and liabilities \\nThe carrying value of borrowings and other assets and liabilities accounted for at amortized cost, except derivative \\nliabilities, represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value \\nat April 30, 2022, and 2021. \\n11.  Related party transactions \\nThe expenses of conducting the business of the Trusts are \\npaid by the GRA. At the end of each financial year, certain of \\nthe Trusts may reimburse the GRA in accordance with the \\nIMF’s Articles of Agreement and relevant decisions of the \\nExecutive Board. On July 14,  2021, the Executive Board \\napproved a suspension of the reimbursement by the PRG \\nTrust to the GRA for financial years 2022 to 2026. As a \\nresult, the estimated reimbursement of SDR 76 million by the \\nPRG Trust to the GRA was forgone during the financial year  ended April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, the Executive Board approved a waiver of the \\nreimbursement estimated at SDR 87 million. \\nThere were no reimbursements to the GRA from the \\nPRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts during the financial years ended \\nApril 30, 2022, and 2021. \\nIn addition to bilateral contributions from member countries, \\nthe IMF also made contributions to the Trusts to meet the \\nfinancing needs of low-income member countries. Cumulative contributions from  the IMF were as follows: \\nDuring the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the PRG Trust Reserve Account received SDR 84 million in contributions from the IMF thr ough the SDA (no contributions \\nreceived from the IMF during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). \\n12.

Our \\nresponsibil ities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit \\nof the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International \\nMonetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant \\nethical requirements relating to our audits,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United \\nStates of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for \\nProfessional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.  \\n \\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial \\nStatements  \\n \\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in \\naccordanc e with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting \\nStandards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the \\npreparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error.  \\n \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Administered \\nAccounts’ ability to continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twe lve months from the end \\nof the reporting period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going \\nconcern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Administered Accounts  or \\nto cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  \\n \\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Administered Accounts ’ financial \\nreporting process.  \\n \\nAuditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  \\n   \\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that \\nincludes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and \\ntherefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always \\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing \\nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material \\nif there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment \\nmade by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  \\n \\n   \\n \\nIn performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: \\n \\n● Exercise professional judgment and maintain profession al skepticism throughout the audit.  \\n● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \\nfraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such \\nprocedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \\nthe financial statements.  \\n● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit \\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpo se of expressing an \\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Administered Accounts’  internal control.

Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 117 Notes to the Financial Statement s for the Financial Years Ended \\nApril 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 1.  Nature of operations \\nAt the request of its members,  the International Monetary \\nFund (IMF) has established special-purpose accounts (the \\nAdministered Accounts) to administer resources contributed \\nfor financial and technical services consistent with the purposes of the IMF. The instruments establishing the \\nAdministered Accounts provide t he terms and conditions, as \\nagreed with the IMF and contri buting members, under which \\nthe resources may be used. The assets and liabilities of each account and each subaccount are separate from the assets \\nand liabilities of all other accounts of, or administered by, the \\nIMF. The assets of each account and each subaccount are \\nnot to be used to discharge liabilities or to cover losses incurred in the administration of other accounts. \\n1.1  Technical Assistance and Special Purpose \\nAccounts \\n1.1.1  Supplementary Financi ng Facility Subsidy Account \\n(SFF Subsidy) \\nThe account was established in December 1980 to assist low-income member countries to meet the costs of using \\nresources made available through the IMF’s Supplementary \\nFinancing Facility and under the policy on exceptional \\naccess. All repurchases under these policies were due on or \\nbefore January 31, 1991, and the final subsidy payments \\nwere approved in July 1991. One member (Sudan), overdue \\nin the payment of charges to the General Department of the \\nIMF at April 30, 2021, remained eligible to receive previously \\napproved subsidy payments of SDR 0.9 million.  \\nOn June 29, 2021, Sudan settled its overdue charges in the \\nGeneral Department, and the account was terminated. On August 1, 2021, the account was liquidated upon completion \\nof the subsidy operations. \\n1.1.2  Administered Account—People’s Bank of China \\n(People’s Bank of China) \\nThe account was established in June 2012 to administer and invest resources provided by the People’s Bank of China to \\nsupport the IMF’s technical assistance and training \\nprograms. During the financial year ended April 30, 2018, the \\ninstrument governing the account was amended to extend \\nthe termination date of the acc ount to October 1, 2022. The \\naccount will be terminated upon completion of operations, or \\nat such earlier time by the IMF in consultation with the \\nPeople’s Bank of China. Once  the obligation to repay the \\noutstanding deposit has been discharged and the final payment of interest has been made, any surplus remaining in the account will be transferred to the People’s Bank of China. \\n1.1.3  Somalia Administered Account (Somalia) \\nThe account was established in December 2019 to facilitate \\nfundraising for, and delivery of, debt relief to Somalia in \\nrespect of obligations owed to the IMF. The resources of the \\naccount consist of contributions by donors and are to be \\nused in the context of deliv ering Heavily Indebted Poor \\nCountries (HIPC) Init iative debt relief, as well as to provide \\nadditional debt relief to Somalia beyond-HIPC assistance once Somalia reaches the HIPC completion point. The \\naccount shall remain in effect for as long as is necessary to \\nconduct the business of the account. Any balances remaining in the account on the date of  its termination and after the \\ndischarge of all obligations of the account shall be transferred \\nto the PRG-HIPC Trust for use in accordance with the \\nprovisions of the PRG-HIPC Trust Instrument provided that, at the request of any contribut or, the contributor’s pro rata \\nshare of any such resources remaining in the account, or any portion of such share, shall be returned to the contributor. \\n1.1.4  Administered Account for Sudan (Sudan) \\nThe account was established in May 2021 to facilitate \\nfundraising for, and delivery of, debt relief to Sudan in \\nrespect of obligations owed to the IMF. The resources of the \\naccount consist of contributions by donors and are to be \\nused in the context of delivering HIPC debt relief, as well as \\nto provide additional debt relief to Sudan beyond-HIPC \\nassistance once Sudan reaches the HIPC completion point. The account shall remain in effect for as long as is necessary \\nto conduct the business of the account. Any balances \\nremaining in the account on the date of its termination and after the discharge of all obligat ions of the account shall be \\ntransferred to the PRG-HIPC Trust for use in accordance with the provisions of the PRG-HIPC Trust Instrument \\nprovided that, at the request of any contributor, the \\ncontributor’s pro rata share of any such resources remaining \\nin the account, or any portion of such share, shall be returned \\nto the contributor. \\n1.1.5  Administered Account for Ukraine (Ukraine) \\nThe account was established in April 2022 to channel \\nresources in the form of grants and loans from members, \\ntheir official institutions, and intergovernmental agencies and organizations (together referred to as “donors”) to assist \\nUkraine in meeting its balanc e of payments and budgetary \\nneeds in order to help stab ilize its economy. While the \\naccount may hold resources provided by donors, it is set up IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n118 to primarily operate as a pass-through vehicle. Accordingly, \\ngrants, loans, repayments, an d interest payments received \\ninto the account are expected to be disbursed or transferred promptly when instructed by a donor. The account may be \\nterminated at any time by the IMF or by a unanimous \\ndecision of all existing donors. Any balances remaining in the \\naccount on the date of its termination and after the discharge \\nof all obligations of the acc ount shall be transferred promptly \\nto donors in line with their contributions. Each donor may \\ninstruct that all or a spec ified amount be transferred to \\nUkraine, or be utilized for such other purposes as may be mutually agreed between the donor and the IMF. \\nIn June 2022, the Government of Canada disbursed through \\nthe account a 1 billion Canadian dollars loan (SDR 585,764 \\nthousand) to Ukraine. \\n1.1.6  Administered Account—Japan (Japan) \\nThe account was established in March 1989 to administer \\nresources provided by Japan—and, under a subsequent amendment, by other countries with Japan’s concurrence—\\nthat are to be used to assist certain members with overdue \\nobligations to the IMF. The resources of the account are to \\nbe disbursed in amounts specified by Japan and to members \\ndesignated by Japan. Effective March 5, 2008, the instrument governing the account was amended to allow the provision of \\nassistance to these member s in the context of an \\ninternationally agreed comprehensive package that \\nintegrates arrears clearance and subsequent debt relief. \\nEffective April 9, 2020, the inst rument governing the account \\nwas further amended to enable Japan to support a broader \\nrange of IMF activities, including contributing to debt relief \\nunder the Catastrophe Containm ent and Relief (CCR) Trust. \\nThe account can be terminated by the IMF or at the request of Japan at any time. Upon termination of the account, any \\nremaining resources in the account are to be returned to Japan. \\n1.1.7  Framework Administered Account for Selected Fund \\nActivities (Framework—SFA) The account was established in March 2009 to administer \\nexternally contributed resources that are to be used to \\nfinance selected IMF activities, including the full range of IMF technical assistance activities provided to recipients. \\n \\nThe financing of selected IMF activities is implemented through the establishment and  operation of subaccounts \\nwithin the Framework—SFA. At April 30, 2022, there were \\n47 subaccounts; no new subaccounts were established during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (one during the \\nfinancial year ended April 30, 2021); and no subaccounts \\nwere terminated during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (three during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). \\nDisbursements are made from the respective subaccounts \\nunder the Framework—SFA to the General Resources Account to reimburse the IMF for costs incurred in connection with activities financed by the respective \\nsubaccounts. Framework—SFA resources are to be used in \\naccordance with terms and conditions established by the IMF, with the concurrence of contributors. Resources in \\nFramework—SFA subaccounts may be transferred to other subaccounts if the terms and c onditions of the subaccounts \\nso provide. \\nThe Framework—SFA may be terminated by the IMF at any \\ntime with the concurrence of all contributors and the \\nManaging Director. A subaccount may also be terminated at the request of the contributor to the subaccount or, in the \\ncase of a subaccount comprising resources from more than \\none contributor, by all the cont ributors participating in the \\nsubaccount at the time of termination. Contributors may \\ncease participation in a subac count at any time without \\ntermination of the subaccount. The disposition of any balances, net of liabilities and commitments under the activities financed, is governed by the conditions agreed \\nbetween the IMF and the contri butor(s). Absent such \\nagreement, the balances are returned to the contributor(s) upon withdrawal from or termination of the subaccount. \\n1.1.8  Administered Account—Switzerland (Switzerland) \\nThe account was established in  February 2017 to facilitate \\nthe settlement of payments u nder the bilateral financing \\nagreement between the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). The account was \\nterminated on March 3, 2022, upon the NBU’s repayment in \\nfull of the outstanding obligat ions and termination of the \\nbilateral loan agreement. \\n1.2  Interim Holdings of Resources Accounts \\n1.2.1  Framework Interim A ccount (Framewo rk Interim) \\nThe account was established in December 2019 to receive and hold any resources of participants, pending instructions of each participant as to the disposition of its share of such \\nresources. The establishment of a Framework Interim \\nAccount, with subaccounts for specific initiatives, aims to reduce costs and streamline t he administration of such \\nresources. Resources for each subaccount are to be administered separately within the Framework Interim Account. At April 30, 2022, there were 7 subaccounts;  one \\nnew subaccount was established during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (one during the financial year ended \\nApril 30, 2021). The account (and any subaccount) can be \\nterminated by the IMF at any time. At termination any remaining balances will be repaid in full to participants. IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 119 1.2.2  Administered Account for Interim Holdings of Voluntary \\nContributions for Fund Activities (Voluntary Contributions) \\nThe account was established in April 2010 to receive and \\nhold externally contributed resources for an interim period until such time as they can be transferred to other Trusts or \\naccounts administered by the IMF. The resources deposited \\ninto the Interim Holdings Account will ultimately fund activities \\nfor which understandings or modalities to use those \\nresources are not yet finalized. The account may be terminated by the IMF at any time, and uncommitted \\nresources in the account at the time of termination are to be \\nreturned to the contri butors. There were no balances in this \\naccount at April 30, 2022, and 2021, and no transactions for \\nthe financial years then ended.  \\n2.  Basis of preparation and measurement \\nThe financial statements of t he Administered Accounts are \\nprepared in accordance with International Financial \\nReporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International \\nAccounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial \\nstatements have been prepared under the historical cost \\nconvention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments \\nat fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements \\nhave also been prepared on the basis that the Administered \\nAccounts will continue to operate as a going concern, except \\nfor the SFF Subsidy and Switzerland Administered Accounts, \\nwhich were terminated during the financial year ended April \\n30, 2022. \\n2.1  Unit of account \\n2.1.1  Japan, Framework—SFA, Switzerland, and Voluntary \\nContributions \\nThe functional and reporting currency of these accounts is \\nthe US dollar. All transacti ons and operations of these \\naccounts, including the transfers to and from these accounts \\nand interest payments, are denominated in US dollars. \\nContributions denominated in other currencies are converted \\ninto US dollars upon receipt of the funds. \\n2.1.2  SFF Subsidy, People’s Bank of China, Somalia, \\nSudan, Ukraine, and Framework Interim \\nThe financial statements for these accounts are presented in SDRs in accordance with the terms of these accounts. The \\nSDR is the IMF’s unit of account. Its value is determined daily \\nby the IMF by summing spec ific amounts of the basket \\ncurrencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. Contributions denominated in other currencies are converted into the component currencies in \\nthe SDR basket upon receipt of the funds.  \\nThe IMF generally reviews the composition of the SDR \\nvaluation basket at five-year intervals.  \\nThe weights and amounts of the currencies in the SDR \\nbasket, effective October 1, 2016, were as follows: \\nSDR basket \\ncurrency  Weight (in percent) Amount \\nChinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174 \\nEuro 30.93 0.38671 \\nJapanese yen 8.33   11.900 \\nPound sterling 8.09 0.085946 \\nUS dollar  41.73 0.58252 \\nAt April 30, 2022, one SDR was equal to US$1.34430 \\n(US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  \\nThe current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled \\nto expire on September 30, 2021. However, the IMF \\nExecutive Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  \\nOn May 11, 2022, the IMF Ex ecutive Board concluded the \\nquinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR \\nand agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR \\ncurrency and interest rate baskets and approved their \\nupdated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher \\nweights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, \\naccordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, \\nthe euro, and the Japanese yen.  \\nEffective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket \\nwill be assigned the following weights:  \\nSDR basket currency Weight (in percent) \\nChinese renminbi 12.28 \\nEuro 29.31 \\nJapanese yen 7.59 \\nPound sterling 7.44 \\nUS dollar  43.38 \\n \\nThe amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated \\non July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the \\nnew weights. The next review of the method of valuation of \\nthe SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the \\ninterim justify an earlier review. IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n120 2.2  SDR interest rate \\nThe SDR interest rate is used to calculate interest income on \\nresources held in SDRs.  \\nThe SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a \\nweighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments \\nin the money markets of the members whose currencies are \\nincluded in the SDR valuation basket as follows:  \\nSDR basket currency Yield or rate \\nChinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China \\nTreasury bonds as published by the China \\nCentral Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. \\nEuro Three-month spot rate for euro area central \\ngovernment bonds with a minimum rating of \\nAA published by the European Central Bank \\nJapanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills \\nPound sterling Three-month Treasury bills \\nUS dollar Three-month Treasury bills \\n \\nThe SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent and is rounded to three decimal places. The average \\nSDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum and \\n0.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\n2.3  Use of estimates and judgement \\nThe preparation of financ ial statements requires \\nmanagement to make judgements, estimates, and \\nassumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies \\nand the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and \\nexpenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an \\nongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and \\nin any future pe riods affected.  \\nThe most significant estimates and judgements used in applying accounting policies include fair value measurement \\nof financial instruments (see Note 3.7). \\n3.  Summary of significant accounting policies \\n3.1  Cash and cash equivalents \\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other highly liquid short-term investments that are readily conv ertible to a known amount of \\ncash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for \\ninvestment or other purposes. 3.2  Investments \\nInvestments held in the People ’s Bank of China account are \\nmanaged in accordance with the Administered Accounts’ risk management and investment strategy, and their performance \\nis evaluated on a fair value basis. As a result, these securities are classified at fa ir value through profit or loss \\n(FVPL) in accordance with their business model. Funds pending suitable investment  in accordance with the \\ninvestment strategy are kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are \\nmeasured at amortized cost. The valuation techniques to determine fair value are described in Note 5. \\n3.2.1  Recognition \\nInvestments are initially recognized on the trade date at which an account becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. \\n3.2.2  Derecognition \\nInvestments are derecognize d on the trade date when the \\ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of \\nthe investment are transferred. \\n3.2.3  Interest and investment income \\nInterest and investment income comprises interest income on \\ncash and cash equivalents and investments, realized gains and losses, and unrealized gains and losses, including currency valuation differences arising from exchange rate \\nmovements against the functional currency. Interest income \\nis recognized on an accrual basis under the effective interest method. \\n3.3  Borrowings \\nBorrowings are initially recognized at fair value of the amount drawn and are subsequently m easured at amortized cost \\nusing the effective interest method. \\n3.4  Contributions \\nContributions are recognized in  the financial statements after \\nthe achievement of specified conditions and are subject to \\nthe bilateral agreements stipul ating how the resources are to \\nbe used. \\n3.5  Operating expenses \\nOperating expenses consist of reimbursements to the IMF for \\nprogram and administrative costs incurred on behalf of technical assistance activities for selected accounts, as \\nagreed between the IMF and contributing members to the \\nAdministered Accounts.  \\n3.6  Conversion gains/(losses) \\nConversion gains/(losses) consist of gains and losses on \\ncontributions received. The gains/(losses) result from the \\ntiming difference between the dat e contributions are received IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 121 and the date of conversion of su ch contributions into the \\nfunctional currency of the account.    \\n3.7  Fair value measurement \\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset \\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value \\nmeasurement is based on th e presumption that the \\ntransaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes \\nplace either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, \\nin the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market. \\nA three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair \\nvalue under which financial instruments are categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. \\nThe fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  \\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical \\nassets or liabilities that the entity can access at the \\nmeasurement date; \\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 \\nthat are observable for the asset or liability, either directly \\n(i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices); \\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on \\nobservable market data (unobservable inputs). \\nWhen the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset \\nor liability fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level within which the fa ir value measurement is \\ncategorized is based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value me asurement of the instrument in \\nits entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may \\ninclude inputs that are both observable and unobservable.  \\n3.8  New and revised International Financial Reporting \\nStandards and interpretations \\n3.8.1  Amendments to existing st andards effective in future \\nyears \\nAmendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial \\nStatements”, and IFRS Practi ce Statement 2, “Making \\nMateriality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting \\npolicy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The \\namendments will be adopted by the Administered Accounts \\nfor the financial year ending April 30, 2024, and are not \\nexpected to have a material effect on the Administered \\nAccounts’ financial statements. \\nAmendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in \\nAccounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February \\n2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or \\nafter January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by \\nthe Administered Accounts for the financial year ending April \\n30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the Administered Accounts ’ financial statements.  \\n4.  Financial risk management  \\nIn administering contributed resources and funding financial and technical services, the Administered Accounts have exposure to credit, liquidity, and market risks.  \\n4.1  Credit risk \\nCredit risk on investment acti vities represents the potential \\nloss that the Administered Acc ounts may incur if obligors and \\ncounterparties default on their c ontractual obligations. Credit \\nrisk is minimized by holding resources at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  an international financial \\ninstitution that provides financ ial services to central banks \\nand other international financial institutions.  \\n4.2  Liquidity risk \\nLiquidity risk is the risk of nonavailability of resources to meet \\nfinancing needs and obligations. Liquidity risk is monitored to \\nensure that upcoming payments or transfers can be met from the Administered Accounts’ cash and highly liquid \\ninvestments. For the People’s  Bank of China account, the \\nprincipal resources are invested with the objective to \\ngenerate income to support the agreed technical assistance \\nand training activities while preserving the principal in \\nnominal terms. The maturity of the investments matches the repayment of the principal to the People’s Bank of China due \\nin October 2022. \\n4.3  Market risk \\nMarket risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows \\nof financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in \\nmarket prices. Market risk includes interest rate risk and \\nexchange rate risk. \\n4.3.1  Interest rate risk \\nInterest rate risk is the risk that  fair value or future net cash \\nflows will fluctuate because of changes in market interest \\nrates. The resources in the People’s Bank of China account \\nare invested in BIS fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost, and medium-term instruments (MTIs), \\nwhich are subject to mark-to-ma rket interest rate risk.  \\n4.3.2  Exchange rate risk Exchange rate risk is the risk that the entity’s financial \\nposition and cash flows will be affected by fluctuations in prevailing foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rate \\nrisk is managed, to the extent possible, by holding all IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n122 financial assets and liabilities in the functional currency of \\neach account or, in the case of accounts whose unit of \\naccount is the SDR, in the constituent currencies included in \\nthe SDR valuation basket. The exchange rate risk on investments held by the People’s Bank of China account is \\nmanaged by investing in MTIs and fixed-term deposits \\ndenominated in the constituent currencies included in the \\nSDR’s valuation basket with the relative amount of each \\ncurrency matching its weight in  the SDR basket. In addition, \\nthe currency composition of the account is adjusted \\nperiodically to align with the SDR basket; therefore, exchange rate ri sk is minimal. \\n4.3.3  Value at Risk \\nExposures to market risk are measured using value at risk \\n(VaR). The VaR estimates reported below represent the maximum potential loss in value of the assets over the next \\nyear due to adverse market movements, with a 95 percent \\nconfidence level. There is a 1 in 20 chance that annual \\nlosses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the \\nreported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the \\nreported VaR by a significant amount. \\nThe VaR model is based on historical simulations and \\nmonthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios to produce plausible future \\nscenarios based on these simulations. In each simulation \\nscenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations, and each instrument is \\nrepriced, resulting in a hypothetical distribution of returns. \\nThere is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the \\ninvestments involves many assumptions and some limited \\nproxy or substitutes. Different assumptions or methodologies \\nwould produce significantly different VaR estimates. \\nThe VaR was SDR 392 thousand at April 30, 2022 \\n(SDR 382 thousand at April 30, 2021). 5.  Investments \\nThe investments of the Peopl e’s Bank of China account \\ncomprised the following: \\n April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021 \\n(in thousands of SDRs)  \\nFixed-term deposits  93,419  18,885 \\nMedium-term instruments (BIS) 75,908  150,933 \\nTotal 169,327  169,818 \\nThe fixed-term deposits held at April 30, 2022, and 2021, mature in financial year 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nMedium-term instruments (BIS ) held at April 30, 2022, \\nmature in financial year 2023 (medium-term instruments \\n(BIS) held at April 30, 2021, mature in financial years 2022 and 2023). \\nBIS MTIs are not traded in an active market; consequently, \\ntheir fair value is determined based on a compilation of \\nsignificant observable market information such as recently \\nexecuted trades in securities of the issuer or comparable \\nissuers and yield curves. The investments are categorized as \\nLevel 2 based on the fair value hierarchy.  \\nInvestment income for the Administered Accounts consisted \\nof interest income only, except for the People’s Bank of China account, whose investment income comprised the \\nfollowing: \\n 2022 2021 \\n(in thousands of \\nSDRs)  \\nInvestment loss on FVPL investments (780) (357) \\nInterest income on investments at amortized cost 937 773 \\nTotal 157 416 \\nIV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 \\n \\n 123 6.  Borrowings \\nThe People’s Bank of China account was funded by an \\nSDR 170,000 thousand loan from the People’s Bank of China \\non July 2, 2012. Upon its initia l maturity on July 2, 2017, the \\nloan was renewed for another five years. The interest on the loan is one-tenth of 1 perc ent per annum, payable annually, \\nbut only if the net investment earnings on the corresponding investment exceed that amount per annum. \\n7.  Operating expenses \\nThe expenses of conducting the ac tivities of the Administered \\nAccounts are paid by the Gene ral Department of the IMF, \\nand the terms of some accounts provide for the partial reimbursements to the General  Department of the IMF for \\nsuch expenses.  \\nSwitzerland account reimbursements amounted to \\nUS$16 thousand and US$20 thousand for the financial years \\nended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  \\nFramework—SFA account reimbursements amounted to \\nUS$150,590 thousand and US$126,680 thousand for the \\nfinancial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  8.

NAFLD is the most \\ncommon cause of abnormal liver function tests in primary care. It is associated with obesity, insulin \\nresistance, Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, hypertension and is considered as hepatic manifestation of the Metabolic \\nsyndrome. The pivotal issue in managing patients with NAFLD is the diagnosis of steatohepatitis & fibrosis at \\nearly stage. Liver biopsy (the Gold standard for diagnosing & assessing fibrosis) is not considered appropriate \\nas first line tool for diagnosing fibrosis in unselected NAFLD patients. This test has high negative predictive \\nvalue, thus can be used as first line test to rule out patients without advanced fibrosis thereby preventing \\nunnecessary secondary care referrals.\\nUses\\n·Metabolic syndrome / Diabetes with suspected NAFLD\\nPatientReportSCSuperPanel.GENERAL_PANEL_ANALYTE_SC (Version: 6)*135091274*\\n.\\nPage 1 of 2\\nLPL - LPL-ROHINI (NATIONAL REFERENCE \\nLAB)\\nSECTOR - 18, BLOCK -E ROHINI\\nDELHI 110085\\nName        \\nA/c Status Lab No.    \\nRef By : Gender: Age: \\nReport Status    Reported        Received            Collected        \\nP:\\n:\\n::\\n:\\n:\\n:Final30 Years15/9/2017   3:37:00PM\\n15/9/2017   3:59:23PM\\n135091274 Male\\nDr. UNKNWONMr.   Z836\\n19/9/2017  7:26:39PM\\nTest Name Results Units Bio.

The logistics branch of Adani is in charge of \\noverseeing all business activ ities, including shipping and warehousing.  \\nDue to its engagement in initiatives like the Carmichael coal mine in Australia, which has drawn resistance from environmenta l organizations due to \\nworries about its effects on the Great Barrier Reef and climate change, the group has come under fire and controversy. Also, the business has been accused \\nof violating the environment and human rights as a result of its operations.  \\nAdani has continued to grow and expand its economic interests both domestically and inte rnationally despite these challenges, and the Indian corporate \\nsector regards it as a significant player.  \\nAn independent investment research company Known as “Hindenburg Research” focuses on forensic financial analysis and investig ative reporting. The \\ncompany is renowned for its critical and frequently contentious reports on publicly traded firms that it posts on its website  and social media. When \\nHindenburg Research released a report in 2018 criticizing the Chinese firm Luckin Coffee for falsely misrep resenting its sales figures, the company \\nattracted considerable media attention. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry and Luckin Coffee's delisting fr om the NASDAQ stock \\nexchange were both outcomes of the study.   \\nSince that time, Hindenburg  Research has released research on a variety of different businesses, including the producer of electric and hydrogen -powered \\nautomobiles Nikola Company, and the supplier of health insurance Clover Health Investments. These reports have generated a lo t of debate and \\noccasionally have caused the stock price of the target firm to drop significantly. Although Hindenburg Research has come unde r fire for its aggressive \\nstrategy and for perhaps making money when the stock prices of the firms it targets fall, the company insists that its findings are founded on in -depth \\nstudy and analysis of publicly available data. The company adds that safeguarding investors from deceptive or dishonest corpo rate behaviour  is its main \\nobjective.  \\nMethodology  \\nHindenburg Research  formulated  a researcher of 300 + pages citing many questions to Adani Group to over its alleged fundings to  International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 5, pp 2 634-2637 May 2023                                      2635  \\n \\n Hindenburg Research  published report  on Jan. 24  right before Adani Enterprises FPO, squaring  off an 86 Billons  $ from  the market’s  domestically listed \\nstocks  and sell -off in its bonds listed overseas.   \\nHindenburg Research makes money by short selling the stocks of companies it has investigated and found to be overvalued or fr audulent. (Short ing of \\nshares  involves borrowing shares of  a company , selling them  at the market  price  or subsequently  buying them back at a lower price and giving back the \\nstock to the original seller in order to profit from the difference  of the buying price and selling price.)  \\nIf Hindenburg Research's investigative reporting causes a company's stock price to fall, the firm could potentially profit from its short positions.  \\nBefore the report gets public Hindenburg  Took a short position on Adani with the funded by various other investors who gets the inpu t of the research \\nbeforehand by the Hindenburg  itself and due to foreign exchange rate and various others factors restricting them not to short Adani shares directly from \\nforeign land  with the heavy funding its plac ed short position on the Adani bonds , and published the research right before Adani FPO.  \\nWith the report getting public it raised questions like  revolving money within the shell companies  and situated in  Tax havens and raised points on debts \\namount of the company. Adani, who was the third -richest man in the world until last week, is now ranked number 15 on the Forbes rich list as a result of \\nthe collapse in the value of the Adani group's equities.  \\nQuestions asked by the Hindenburg  on the  Adani Group's Includes:  \\n• Adani Power auditor  affiliated  to EY , took an  opposite  negative stance on  supporting the valuations of the investments and loans.  saying there \\nis no way to support the total value of 56.75  billion rupees  in debt and  invest ment  took by Adani Power.  Where did the auditor  find differences  \\nwith Adani Power's investment and loan valuation?  \\n• Adani was part of the  infamous Dimond  scandal investigation  by government agencies  (2004 -2006)  regarding the Adani  exports  ltd exports  \\nthat were 3 times more than the total exports in comparison to all the other 34 organization  in the industrie s combined . Why was Adani \\nscrutinized by the agencies over the surge in the export s? \\n• Adani receives  constant investments from  Some shell com panies situated in Moretisous  to revolve the amount and to buy back  its own  shares  \\ncreating a positive sentiment in the market about the company hence pumping  up the company’s share  price . \\n• According to recent right -to-information requests, SEBI is investigating Adani's ownership of foreign funds in shares and providing u pdates \\non the status of that investigation. However, the information that has so far been made public in connection with any investi gations is \\nprivileged.  \\n• New Leaina is a Cyprus -based company that holds 95% of the value of its portfolio in shares of every  Adani listed company. Amicorp is the \\nentity's operator. Where did New Leaina get the money for its investments in Adani?  \\n• In 2019, Adani Green Energy did two offerings for sale that were important  in ensure ring  its public shareholders were over the 25  % listing \\nthreshold requirement. What proportion of these OFS agreements, if any, were put up for sale to international buyers, such as those from \\nMauritius and Cyprus, as stated previously in the report?  \\n• Adani decided against using a big, well -known brok er and instead hired Monarch Net Worth Capital, a small company that had previously \\nbeen suspended and fined by SEBI on accusations of market manipulation, to manage the offerings.  \\n• Earlier SEBI has also investigated and penalized  more than 70 firms  and in dividuals, including Adani promoters, for  stock manipulation  of \\nAdani between 1999 to 2005.  \\n• SEBI ruled that Adani promoters helped Ketan Parekh manipulate the shares of Adani Exports, which is now called Adani Enterpr ises. The \\ndecision showed that 14 Adani private companies gave shares to entities that Parekh controlled  How can Adani account for the organised and \\nmethodical manipulation of its share price that was carried out by one of India's most Infamous  and convicted stock market  scammer ? \\n• Ketan Pa rekh continues to work on deals with his former clients, including Adani, according to people close to him. How extensive was  and \\nis the link between Parekh and the Adani Group, including any connections either party may have had with Vinod Adani?  \\n• In 2021 Times of India's journalist Suchita Dalal indicated the shell company structure within one organization without naming  any corporate \\nhouse whatsoever,  still the only conglomerate to take the maximum hit was the Adani group where share hit a lower ci rcuit for a few weeks \\nafter Dalal's tweet.  \\n• • In order to minimise potential conflicts of interest and accounting irregularities, investors generally favour clean, strai ghtforward corporate \\nstructures. In the fiscal year 2022, the seven major listed compan ies owned by Adani had a combined 578 subsidiaries and 6,025 distinct \\nrelated -party transactions. alone, per BSE disclosures. Why did Adani choose a corporate structure that is so complicated and related to other \\ncompanies?  \\n• Adani Enterprises has had 5 chi ef financial officers in the past 8 years, which is a major cautionary sign that may indicate possible accounting \\nissues. Why is it so difficult for Adani Enterprises to keep the top financial position's incumbent?  What were the reasons for the numerous  \\nnumber of resignations and terminations of prior CFOs.  International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 5, pp 2 634-2637 May 2023                                      2636  \\n \\n Aftermath  \\nFor a brief time, Adani group stocks tumbled by about 55 % as was predicted by Hindenburg data most of the stocks and as the report published Credit \\nSuisse is a global financial services company that provides a range of financial services to clients worldwide, including banking, asset management, and \\ninvestment banking services. As a financial services provider, Credit Suisse relies on credit ratings to evaluate the creditw orthiness of pot ential clients \\nand to make informed investment decisions  \\nCredit Suisse bank dropped the credit rating of Adani bonds and those who are already holding these bonds will have to pay ab out 40% - 60% of the \\ninterest on the payback earlier these bonds were AAA rated and after the report went public these bonds were listed in the latter category. As Hindenburg \\nand its clients being foreign companies/individuals couldn’t invest directly in the Indian stock market they bet against the bonds offered by Adani as its \\nvalue dropped after the AAA rating seeped away.  \\nAdani Answers were more of a Hit and miss mostly highlighting the points in public knowledge and more were released as a 400 -page answer to the \\nHindenburg . \\nAnalysis :  Who’s Right Who’s Wrong ? \\nHindenburg's  claim is like they’ve drawn the conclusion first and go into analysis that suits them Concluding too quickly and without suff icient evidence \\ncan be a major problem, and unfortunately, Hindenburg tends to do this with ease. They may jump to conclusions bas ed on incomplete or biased \\ninformation, leading to inaccurate or unfair judgments. Additionally, drawing conclusions without careful consideration can l ead to missed opportunities \\nand poor decision -making in business and research settings. It's crucial to maintain objectivity and critical thinking skills to avoid making hasty or \\ninaccurate conclusions that can harm individuals or organizations.   \\nFor example, Hindenburg isn’t covered by any analyst in comparison to similar -sized companies. And raising points  like Adani has young accounts to \\naudit their funds. Although some points are somewhat like the exponential growth of the company and party Transactions.   \\nHowever, people claim Adani's growth is also because of its investments in various infrastructures in  India over the period Adani has received contracts \\nof airports operations for the next 50 years and all these contracts’ bids were placed by Adani backed by debts based on Adan i’s share value.  \\nImpact on the Retail Market and Investors  \\nThe report trigge red heavy selling of Adani shares in a large value their price value decreased and the retail investor portfolio took a signi ficant drop in \\nits value, this resulted in a mass panic sell until incurring a lower circuit within an intraday, the Indian stock i ndex i.e., Nifty 50 was already very volatile \\nsince last year and Adani group nose dive added fuel to the fire hence most of other companies stocks also depleted 10 to 15%  of its value however other \\nthan Adani stocks all other companies stock rose back fur ther from its drop price within a week and Nifty 50 stared to go above staidly however Adani \\nstocks such as Adani enterprise, Adani Green and Adani transmission are still down by over 50% since their all -time high. Therefore, if the retail investor \\nwho was  very much inclined onto the Adani group portfolio at the start of this year would be seeing their portfolio at a significant loss but many new \\ninvestors came in after the drop and publishing of the Research so that they can buy those shares at a low or di scounted price and making a quick and \\nheavy profit.  \\nFindings  \\n \\nThe solid US market and unpredictable Indian market contrast :  \\nBefore the release  of the report  Indian market was in turmoil due to various factors like Ukraine Russia war and recession in the west however after  the \\nreport got public Indian market showed volatility and has been doing so ever since in comparison to the US Nasdaq which is now stable and bullish  on \\nthe trend  \\nAccord ing to many investment experts this is due to Adani  shares being volatile which is s trongly  impacting the Indian index and constantly floating \\nbetween the resistance and support line while many other factors impacting the market  people sentiments towards  Adani might be the result of  sluggish \\nand volatile market  in comparison to other factors and since , SEBI is still looking  into the matter so its safe to say this Volatility  might continue  for a few \\nmore months and as US market trends up the Nifty might  make up for it by replicating the trend  in coming time.  \\nConclusion  \\nThe Hindenburg report on Adani Group is a timely reminder of the urgent need for businesses to prioritize sustainability, eth ics, and social responsibility. \\nThe report raises serious concer ns about the environmental impact and financial and operational practices of Adani Group, highlighting the need for \\nincreased scrutiny and regulation of businesses to ensure they are operating in the best interests of all stakeholders.  International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 5, pp 2 634-2637 May 2023                                      2637  \\n \\n As investors, we ha ve a responsibility to carefully assess the risks associated with our investments, including the social and environmental imp act of the \\ncompanies in which we invest. We must make informed decisions based on a company's track record in sustainability and et hical practices. Similarly, \\nregulators have a responsibility to closely examine the issues raised in the report and take appropriate action to address an y shortcomings in existing \\nregulatory frameworks.  \\nIn conclusion, the Hindenburg report emphasizes the need for a fundamental shift in how we approach business and its relationship with society and the \\nenvironment. Businesses must prioritize sustainability and social responsibility in all aspects of their operations, and regu lators and investors must work \\ntogether to ensure that they are held accountable for any practices that fall short of these standards. Only by doing so can w e build a more sustainable and \\njust world for future generations.  \\nReferences  \\nThe Adani -Hindenburg saga: A complete guide to what’s happened so far | Business News,The Indian Express  \\nAdani Group: How The World’s 3rd Richest Man Is Pulling The Largest Con In Corporate History – Hindenburg Research  \\nhttps://hindenburgresearc h.com/adani -response/  \\nExplainer: Adani vs Hindenburg: What you need to know | Reuters  \\nAdani vs Hindenburg: What happened so far - India Today  \\nHindenburg's allegations vs Adani's response: Shell companies, money launderin g, Vinod Adani's role - BusinessToday  \\nAdani vs Hindenburg - is Hindenburg lying?

Photo taken by Joseph Klim, PhD, in the lab of Harvard University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher Kevin Eggan, PhD, professor in the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University.What are stem cells?\\nCells are the building blocks of all living things. Each type of cell plays a different role in \\nthe human body. A stem cell is a special type of cell; specific types of body cells (such as skin cells, intestine cells, or red blood cells) are formed from stem cells. \\nSome stem cells are able to develop into every kind of body cell. Other stem cells are \\nmore limited and can become several different kinds of cells, but not every kind of body cell. For example, stem cells in bone marrow (found inside your bones) can become red blood cells and white blood cells and all of the other parts of blood. However, these stem cells cannot become skin cells. \\nWhat is a stem cell line?\\nStem cells grown in a lab are called stem cell “lines.” A cell line is a group of cells that come from a single tissue sample (e.g., a blood sample or tissue taken from a muscle, which is called a “biopsy”). Each cell in a cell line will have the same genes as the tissue \\nsample that it came from.\\nAll stem cell lines:\\nCan divide to make copies of themselves; for this reason, a stem cell line growing in a \\nlab could exist for a very long time, even longer than your lifetimeCan become some other types of body cellsContain the same genetic information as the person who gave the sample \\nTypes of stem cells used in research\\nThere are three main types of stem cells that scientists use in research: \\nBody cells (such as skin cells or blood cells) that are made into stem cells in the labo-ratory are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). It is believed that iPS cell lines can become any type of body cell.\\nStem cells that naturally occur in the body are called somatic or adult stem cells. These \\ncells cannot become any type of body cell but they can become some kinds of body \\ncells. Somatic stem cells are very difficult to grow in the lab.\\nEmbryonic stem cells (ES cells) are stem cells that are made from embryos at early \\nstages of development, when the embryo is a very small cluster of cells grown in a laboratory dish. ES cells can become any type of body cell. The embryos that are used to make human ES cells come from people who have had fertility treatments (in vitro fertilization or IVF) to have a baby. After the treatment, some individuals choose to donate their remaining embryos to research. If an embryo is used to make a stem cell line, it can no longer be used for fertility treatments.Why are researchers interested in stem cells?\\nStudying stem cells can help scientists understand more about how the body works  and how disease develops and affects the body. Working with stem cells may help  researchers better understand different diseases and conditions, and find new treat-ments. Scientists hope one day to be able to use stem cells to help replace tissues in  \\nthe body that were damaged by disease or injury. \\nBenefits and risks of participating in stem cell research?\\nBy participating in stem cell research, there’s no direct benefit for you, but taking part \\nmay help others in the future. \\nThe risks involved in providing a tissue sample will depend on the type of sample you  \\nare providing (e.g., blood draw, skin biopsy, cheek swab, bone marrow biopsy, etc.).  The research team will describe the procedure and risks during the informed consent process. A stem cell line made from your tissue contains your genetic information and may be linked to your identity. There is a risk this information could accidentally be shared with others.

Shooting ends automatically when the end of the panorama is reached.\\nAn example of how to pan the camera is shown below. \\nWithout changing your position, pan the camera in a steady curve either horizontally or vertically. Time the pan according to the option selected for Image size  in the shooting menu: \\nabout 15 seconds are needed to complete the pan when Normal panorama  is selected, about 30 seconds when Wide \\npanorama  is selected.Progress indicator\\n66A Panoramas\\nPanorama size can be selected using the Image size  item in the \\nshooting menu; choose from Normal panorama  and Wide panorama  \\n(076). An error message will be displayed if the camera is panned too \\nquickly or unsteadily. Note that because panoramas are composed of \\nmultiple images, the joins between images may be visible and the desired results may not be achieved with moving subjects or with neon lights or other subjects that exhibit rapid changes in color or brightness, subjects that are too close to the camera, poorly-lit \\nsubjects, and subjects such as the sky or sea that are a solid color or contain simple repeating patterns.\\nExposure compensation ( 073) can be used to adjust exposure by up \\nto ±3 EV in steps of \\n1/3EV. Adjust exposure compensation after starting \\nlive view in Step 1.The completed panorama will be slightly smaller than the area visible \\nin the display during shooting. No panorama will be recorded if shooting ends before the halfway point; if shooting ends after the halfway point but before the panorama is complete, the unrecorded portion will be shown in gray. Dates can not be imprinted on panoramas.67❚❚Viewing Panoramas\\nTo view a panorama, display it in full-frame playback ( 026) and \\npress J.

Do not store your camera \\nwith naphtha or camphor moth balls or in locations that:•are poorly ventilated or subject to humidities of over 60%\\n•are next to equipment that pr oduces strong electromagnetic \\nfields, such as televisions or radios\\n•are exposed to temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) or below –10 °C (14 °F)\\nCleaning\\nDo not use alcohol, thinner, or other volatile chemicals .Caring for the Camera\\nCamera \\nbodyUse a blower to remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or \\nseaside, wipe off sand or salt  with a cloth lightly dampened \\nin distilled water and dry thoroughly.  Important : Dust or \\nother foreign matter inside the camera may cause damage not covered under warranty .\\nLens, mirror, and viewfinderThese glass elements are easily damaged.\\n Remove dust \\nand lint with a blower.  If using an aerosol blower, keep the \\ncan vertical to prevent the discharge of liquid.  To remove \\nfingerprints and other stains, apply a small amount of lens \\ncleaner to a soft cloth and clean with care.\\nMonitorRemove dust and lint with a blower.  When removing \\nfingerprints and other stains, wipe the surface lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Do not apply pressure, as this \\ncould result in damage or malfunction.97Caring for the Camera\\nDo not drop : The product may malfunction if subjected to strong shocks or \\nvibration.\\nKeep dry : This product is not waterproof, and may malfunction if \\nimmersed in water or exposed to high levels of humidity.  Rusting of the \\ninternal mechanism can cause irreparable damage.Avoid sudden changes in temperature : Sudden changes in temperature, such \\nas those that occur when entering or leaving a heated building on a cold \\nday, can cause condensation inside the device.\\n To prevent \\ncondensation, place the device in a carrying case or plastic bag before \\nexposing it to sudden changes in temperature.\\nKeep away from strong magnetic fields : Do not use or store this device in the \\nvicinity of equipment that generate s strong electromagnetic radiation \\nor magnetic fields.  Strong static charges or the magnetic fields \\nproduced by equipment such as radio transmitters could interfere with \\nthe monitor, damage data stored on the memory card, or affect the \\nproduct’s internal circuitry.\\nDo not leave the lens pointed at the sun : Do not leave the lens pointed at the \\nsun or other strong light source for an extended period.  Intense light \\nmay cause the image sensor to deterior ate or produce a white blur effect \\nin photographs.Turn the product off before removing or disconnecting the power source : Do not \\nunplug the product or remove the battery while the product is on or \\nwhile images are being recorded or deleted.\\n Forcibly cutting power in \\nthese circumstances could result in loss  of data or in damage to product \\nmemory or internal circuitry.  To prevent an accidental interruption of \\npower, avoid carrying the product from one location to another while the AC adapter is connected.Caring for the Camera and Battery: \\nCautions98Cleaning : When cleaning the camera body, use a blower to gently remove \\ndust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth.  After using the \\ncamera at the beach or seaside, wipe off any sand or salt using a cloth \\nlightly dampened in pure water and then dry the camera thoroughly.\\nThe lens and mirror are easily damaged.  Dust and lint should be gently \\nremoved with a blower.  When using an aerosol blower, keep the can \\nvertical to prevent discharge of liquid.  To remove fingerprints and other \\nstains from the lens, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth \\nand wipe the lens carefully.\\nSee the Reference Manual  for information on cleaning the image sensor.\\nDo not touch the shutter curtain : The shutter curtain is extremely thin and \\neasily damaged.  Under no circumstances should you exert pressure on \\nthe curtain, poke it with cleaning tools, or subject it to powerful air \\ncurrents from a blower.  These actions could scratch, deform, or tear the \\ncurtain.\\nStorage : To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-\\nventilated area.  If you are using an AC adapter, unplug the adapter to \\nprevent fire.  If the product will not be used for an extended period, \\nremove the battery to prevent leakage and store the camera in a plastic \\nbag containing a desiccant.  Do not, however, store the camera case in a \\nplastic bag, as this may caus e the material to deteriorate.  Note that \\ndesiccant gradually loses its capacity to absorb moisture and should be \\nreplaced at regular intervals.\\nTo prevent mold or mildew, take the camera out of storage at least once \\na month.  Turn the camera on and release the shutter a few times before \\nputting it away.\\nStore the battery in a cool, dry place.  Replace the terminal cover before \\nputting the battery away.99Notes on the monitor : The monitor is constructed with extremely high \\nprecision; at least 99.99% of pixels are effective, with no more than 0.01% \\nbeing missing or defective.  Hence while these displays may contain \\npixels that are always lit (white, red, blue, or green) or always off (black), this is not a malfunction and has no effect on images recorded with the device.\\nImages in the monitor may be difficult to see in a bright light.Do not apply pressure to the monitor, as this could cause damage or \\nmalfunction.\\n Dust or lint on the monitor can be removed with a blower.  \\nStains can be removed by wiping lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Should the monitor break, care should be taken to avoid injury \\nfrom broken glass and to prevent liquid crystal from the monitor \\ntouching the skin or entering the eyes and mouth.\\nMoiré : Moiré is an interference pattern created by the interaction of an \\nimage containing a regular, repeating grid, such as the pattern of weave \\nin cloth or windows in a building, with the camera image sensor grid.  If \\nyou notice moiré in your photographs, try changing the distance to the \\nsubject, zooming in and out, or changing the angle between the subject and the camera.\\nD Servicing the Camera and Accessories\\nThe camera is a precision device  and requires regular servicing.  Nikon \\nrecommends that the camera be inspec ted by the original retailer or \\nNikon-authorized service representative once every one to two years, and that it be serviced once every three to five years (note that fees apply to these services).\\n Frequent inspection and servicing are \\nparticularly recommended if the camera is used professionally.  Any \\naccessories regularly used with the ca mera, such as lenses or optional \\nflash units, should be included when the camera is inspected or serviced.100Caring for the Battery\\nBatteries may leak or expl ode if improperly handled.  Observe the \\nfollowing precautions when handling batteries:\\n•Use only batteries approved for use in this equipment.\\n•Do not expose the battery to flame or excessive heat.\\n•Keep the battery terminals clean.\\n•Turn the product off before replacing the battery.\\n•Remove the battery from the camera or charger when not in use and replace the terminal cover. These devices draw minute amounts of \\ncharge even when off and could draw the battery down to the point that it will no longer function. If the battery will not be used for some \\ntime, insert it in the camera and run it flat before removing it and storing it in a location with an ambient temperature of 15 °C to 25 °C (59 °F to 77 °F; avoid hot or extremely cold locations).\\n Repeat this \\nprocess at least once every six months.\\n•Turning the camera on and off repeatedly when the battery is fully discharged will shorten battery life. Batteries that have been fully \\ndischarged must be charged before use.\\n•The internal temperature of the battery may rise while the battery is in use. Attempting to charge the battery while the internal temperature \\nis elevated will impair battery performance, and the battery may not charge or charge only partially. Wait for the battery to cool before \\ncharging.\\n•Continuing to charge the battery after it is fully charged can impair battery performance.101•A marked drop in the time a fully charged battery retains its charge \\nwhen used at room temperature indicates that it requires replacement.  \\nPurchase a new EN-EL14a battery.\\n•Charge the battery before use.  When taking photographs on \\nimportant occasions, ready a spare EN-EL14a battery and keep it fully charged. Depending on your location, it may be difficult to purchase \\nreplacement batteries on short notice.  Note that on cold days, the \\ncapacity of batteries tends to decrease.  Be sure the battery is fully \\ncharged before taking photographs outside in cold weather.  Keep a \\nspare battery in a warm place an d exchange the two as necessary.  \\nOnce warmed, a cold battery may recover some of its charge.\\n•Used batteries are a valuable resource; recycle in accord with local regulations.102This section lists the indicators and error messages that appear \\nin the viewfinder and monitor.Error Messages\\nA Warning Icons\\nA flashing d in the monitor or s in the viewfinder indicates that a \\nwarning or error message can be disp layed in the monitor by pressing \\nthe W (Q) button.\\nIndicator\\nSolution Monitor Viewfinder\\nLock lens aperture ring \\nat minimum aperture (largest f/-number).B  \\n(flashes)Set lens aperture ring to minimum aperture (highest f-number).\\nLens not attachedF /s \\n(flashes)•Attach non-IX NIKKOR lens.\\n•If non-CPU lens is attached, select mode M.\\nBefore taking photos, rotate the zoom ring to extend the lens.F\\n(flashes)A lens with a retractable lens barrel button is attached with the lens barrel retracted.
